What are the differences between psycho-social and sociology?;While social psychology studies the individual as an actor, the subject of action, sociology focuses more on the structure and functioning of large groups or institutions.
What are the differences between social psychology and general psychology?;General psychology and social psychology are both interested in the individual. However, the former has a more individual approach and the latter a more social one. General psychology pays specific attention to the internal functioning of the individual, while social psychology focuses more on how people influence and perceive themselves and their actions in relation to the social environment.
What are the differences between LOC and causal attribution?;First of all the LOC (Locus of Control) corresponds to a general anticipation, an a priori expectation. While an Attribution is an explanation, a judgment made a posteriori on a very specific event. Moreover, the concept of LOC concerns reinforcements ("the law of effect": reproduction of behaviour if positive reinforcements) whereas the concept of attribution refers more to people's behaviour or emotional states.
What could I do when my girlfriend left me after 10 years of living together?;Ten years of living together can only make a difference, regardless of your age. But in a couple, each one evolves, sometimes together and sometimes the opposite. Your friend seems to have taken a direction of freedom. Time will be your ally if she has to come back and wishes to relive a story with you. But maybe not. So try to open yourself up to something else (different activities) and to other people. And you will see things differently. Sincerely.
What could I do when my girlfriend left me after 10 years of living together?;your wife has made it clear from what you say she no longer loves you there is nothing left for you to do but to accept and grieve and leave her without living outside of you without trying to continue to maintain a morbid link.
How to regain an interest in life?;Don't be left alone to mope. As you have been advised, talk about your difficulties and sufferings to your parents, and to your main teacher, if possible before the end of the week to have, before the vacations, an idea of a search for a solution. What would you like to do later? Do you have an idea for a job or studies that attracts you? Is the scientific orientation right for you? Would help during the vacations be able to put you back on your feet and re-motivate you?
How to regain an interest in life?;Find a sport activity for example that suits you. Discover artistic activities and/or go to the cinema, the theater, shows, conferences. It will also allow you to make new friends who will not depend on your school environment. Take care of yourself, be attentive to your lifestyle, your diet, this is essential to cope with life's difficulties and stressful situations. With my encouragement.
My dream is premonitory?;Your dream speaks of your desire. Now that it is clear to you, either you make it happen in reality ... or you continue to dream. Predicting the future is not the job of a psychologist.
Is my dream premonitory?;Nothing can be premonitory, the dream is a safety valve for our body.
Why can't I forget my perverted narcissistic ex-boyfriend?;To begin with, I think that a statement in the gendarmerie should be made for assault and battery in order to protect you but also to protect others. Secondly, I think that this relationship must have provoked a certain amount of physical and psychological fear. In my case, I strongly advise you to consult a psychologist who will tell you how to manage your fears and the fears that are ingrained in you. You can also do hypnosis sessions to let go of all this but before doing so, you should think about consulting a psychologist in order to manage all this.
Why can't I forget my perverted narcissistic ex-boyfriend?;In a relationship between two people and when there is a pervert it is always very important to find out why your relationship is in balance. Indeed as of the first unacceptable behaviors for you, you should have left and you remained to support even more, thus that has a direction for you even if you feel victim, even if you are in a form of masochism, this man came to bring you something in the relation. it is by understanding that that you will be able to leave it and not reproduce again elsewhere.
Why can't I forget my perverted narcissistic ex-boyfriend?;It's quite normal that you don't forget as quickly as that a relationship that must have been traumatic. It seduces you, gets you a job, and then puts you through extreme violence. I hope you have thought about reporting it on the dating site, so that it doesn't continue to be abusive. You now have to rebuild yourself, you have a lot of psychic work to do. You were certainly very afraid when he mistreated you, afraid of dying perhaps when he blocked your breathing! I strongly encourage you to contact either a victim support service at a court or a psychotherapist to get out of the nightmare he made you live with your passive complicity. Do not remain alone with these memories!
How can I restore my man's confidence?;Narcissistic perverts are manipulative, so they know how to seduce you and turn the relationship into something addictive. This may be why you find it hard to forget and have nightmares. I don't know if it's him or you who broke up, but it's a good thing. Be proud of yourself. There's only one thing to do with narcissistic perverts: run away. He may try to come back, and at that point it will be important for you to be strong so you can ignore or push him away. If you feel guilty, know that under no circumstances are you guilty about what happened. 
How can I restore my man's confidence?;Restoring trust to a person means first and foremost trusting him, loving him, adoring him, empowering him, knowing how to forgive, discussing, finding solutions. Act in his interests and your own.
How can I restore my man's confidence?;You seem to be so much in love that you lose your autonomy. And moreover, the first love is not insignificant. Also, you are afraid of losing it. It is important that you find other interests in order to regain your autonomy and your personality (i.e. to live with him but not for him), and to detach yourself from your fear of losing him. If you have been together for 9 years, it means that there is love and that your relationship is serious. But by dint of fear, your behavior, against your conscious will, will eventually drive him away. Go out with friends, enjoy yourself (shopping, fitness, sports, going out...) and if he wants to see his family, do you have to go with him? Make yourself desired to be happy to find yourself afterwards. He needs to see other people and try to understand him on this point. You are young, there are many things to do and you have your life ahead of you. Don't be in too much of a hurry and don't be too impatient. Take your time. To help you let go and feel better about yourself, try meditation, sophrology, yoga... you may find a method that works for you. And if, despite your efforts, this relationship ends, tell yourself that it's not over. There is always something positive in what life gives us, only we don't always see it right away. Have confidence in yourself and in life.
How to react to a person who has paranoid delusions?;If the situation with your friend is bothering you, you need to distance yourself for now. Is this the first time this has happened to her? In any case, if she is in a delirium of persecution or paranoia, do not attack her. You can also talk about it with family and friends to find out if they have been through the same situation before? In any case, don't play into her hands: don't attack her and don't make her feel guilty. If she starts to physically assault you again, call the fire department, they will be able to accompany her to the emergency services nearest her home. Keep me informed.
How to react to a person who has paranoid delusions?;Do you live in or near a major city? If so, and your friend refuses to see a psychiatrist, I recommend that you look up the phone number of SOS Psychiatry, keep it with you and call as soon as a crisis arises. You will then benefit from a home visit, be less exposed, and contact will finally be established.
What are the associations that help paranoid families?;I don't know of any association that deals specifically with paranoid patients or their spouses, and is it prudent or appropriate to advertise (or advertise) under such a name knowing the potential of some of these patients? You can find within associations helping patients and their families in your region (in France?) or on the net you can find interesting sites mostly Canadian dealing with problems of the couple and others for the children of subjects suffering from these disorders you can for example consult the Quebec site.
What are the associations that help paranoid families?;Some choices in life are very difficult and painful. You are in that situation today. Your husband has been under the care of a psychiatrist for many years but he only takes his medication when he feels like it. This shows that your husband has no awareness of his illness: he doesn't realize the seriousness of his paranoia. You are torn between your love for him and the care you can still provide him. This is really admirable on your part, but I think you should listen to the psychiatrist's advice when he tells you to distance yourself. Protect yourself and your children. At the same time, find a professional to support you psychologically because you are going through a difficult time. Also get closer to. Close bones. Speaking of associations, get closer to associations of people with a loved one who has a mental illness. They will be able to provide you with support.
What are the associations that help paranoid families?;Do you know Unafam? Unafam is an association recognized as being of public utility, which welcomes, listens, supports, trains, informs and accompanies the families and the entourage of people living with psychic disorders. You will certainly be able to find on the internet the address closest to your home. Furthermore, I encourage you to look for psychotherapeutic support for yourself in order to help you face a situation that is objectively difficult.
What should I do if I am anxious by nature?;Anxiety if it becomes chronic can be a real torture in everyday life. To relax, you can try relaxation (breathing, massage, meditation), listen to music, practice a sport activity, go for a walk in nature, change the decor of your home. You can also do psychotherapy sessions that will allow you to understand the origin of your anxieties, how to make your emotions flow and find solutions to find a better well-being, that is to say to find a taste for life, the pleasure of doing activities, to take time for yourself.
How can I have a strong character like my friends?;You ask the question of "strength of character" in the sense of the ability to assert oneself, to affirm one's character, to have "the strength to defend one's opinion, one's choice. Your options" even if it means making them accepted, if not imposed on the group, or at least sticking to your personal options without feeling "obliged" to follow the options of others or to erase yourself in front of them. This requires the "audacity" to express yourself without fearing in advance the perhaps critical opinion of others. Also the courage and audacity to believe in the validity of your opinions and your choices without holding them in advance as inferior to those of others: this requires confidence in oneself, in its intrinsic value, the strength of audacity to express one's opinion without retreating before the POSSIBLE existence of one or more different opinions, the audacity of the strength to argue and try to convince without weakening. These traits of "assertiveness" are grouped together under the term "assertiveness" and you are among those who have a problem at this level. Unfortunately, you do not indicate anything about your age, your activity or your life context. In principle, with the help of a shrink, who is willingly a hypnotherapist, you could correct your difficulties, which can be assimilated to a handicap in relational and social life: this can be corrected by making an effort on yourself, guided by the therapist, at least if you are willing to make this effort. I can't tell you more because I don't have enough data.
How can I have a strong character like my friends?;Are you a teenager? Sometimes it's difficult to impose yourself. But I think, above all, that their character is too strong compared to you, that you feel inferior to them. It would be better to have other friends who are more like you, and with whom you can talk about anything without fear of their reactions. By staying with them, you will continue to suffer, and to be a person that you are not... It's a shame, frankly.
Why don't I have any memories of my childhood?;it can happen that one has the impression to have forgotten everything of the period of childhood - it is due to several factors especially of the emotional series - but it is difficult to answer you by not knowing anything about you apart from your age, background, profession, family situation and life of possible couple.
Why don't I have any memories of my childhood?;So far, I've been able to meet people who had different types of memories, concept-related memories (without being able to associate a date to them), emotional memories (who remember what they felt but didn't necessarily see or hear), visual memories, auditory memories? What type of memory do you have and has it happened recently that you find it difficult to remember a person without some other type of clue? A person can also forget everything after a trauma. Perhaps there are still other clues...
Why don't I have any memories of my childhood?;No memories? Or no visual memories? Sometimes it's easier to find sensations, smells, touches, than to see scenes again. Especially when you feel worried, as you do. If necessary, consult a hypnotherapist in order to intensify the tenuous threads that connect you to your childhood. The unconscious never forgets anything...
Why don't I have any memories of my childhood?;Many people have what are called defensive mechanisms that prevent them from recovering their memories, which does not allow them to access their traumas that lead to various problems in their lives. In therapy, the use of hypnosis often helps to reduce resistance and thus to bring back memories.
Why don't I have any memories of my childhood?;Forgetfulness is an ability of our brain. Sometimes we forget where we put our keys when we hold them in our hands. The brain plays tricks on us! I say capacity because it allows us to free the system (the hard disk) to store other important information. Of course, some may not be immediately accessible or not at all. This is often characterized by the way and intensity in which we experienced the situation. I'm sure you remember your last burst of laughter, don't you? So to conclude, it's a matter of identifying the most beautiful memories you've experienced lately, and others again, just to see that everything is going well and that your emotions bring you back unconditionally to your most ingrained memories!
I would like to know a precise definition of cognitive disorders.;Cognitive disorders are simply disorders of cognition, i.e. knowledge or information that affects the memory, but not only. 
How to become mature at 16?;Each person is unique. You're wondering how to become more mature at 16. How old is your boyfriend? What are the elements or facts that make him think you are immature? Is it in the way you talk, dress and behave with others? Is it the way you make decisions, do things, laugh? Is it in the way you love him? At 16 years old, a certain immaturity is not extraordinary because you are still in your teens while you are moving towards adulthood. In a couple, everyone evolves differently but too much difference can destroy the couple. In your situation, your boyfriend seems much more mature than you, so he has different expectations of you, he expects you to behave like an adult. Your immaturity must create discomfort for him towards others and perhaps shame. So try to change your behavior: be more of an adult than a child. This will avoid distension within your couple.
How can I make my husband understand that he has a psychological problem?;I advise you to first take your husband for a consultation with a psychologist or psychotherapist, who will be able to guide you.

Then, depending on your state of addiction, it is important to take stock of your situation with a doctor who will prescribe a check-up and, if necessary, medication to help you, especially if you show signs of withdrawal. Finally, to reconstruct your behavioral pattern and respond differently to what pushes you towards alcohol, complementary therapy is very important. Hypnosis, EFT, or other. Finally, moving physically indicates to your unconscious mind that you want to move. Establish new habits. A.A. is people who will understand you if you accept their help. There is no magic bullet: decide and do what works for you.
How can I stop drinking?;Stopping drinking, so possibly if you decide to do so, short-term therapy can help. Therapy and hypnosis do not help you to make the decision but more importantly to validate the decision and to understand and help.
Existential death anxiety, how to get rid of it?;Anxiety is often linked to the fact that it is difficult to live in the present. Anticipation, which is a normal activity of the brain, with another part looking for solutions to a whole series of hypothetical hypotheses, can become pervasive and harmful. It doesn't matter what logical reasons and explanations you can come up with. Hypnosis, which addresses the unconscious mind, is perfectly suited to solving this type of difficulty.
Existential death anxiety, how to get rid of it?;I invite you to consult a psychologist-psychotherapist to talk about your death anxieties and understand where they come from in order to calm them. Talking about them in therapy will allow you to work on them, to express your emotions and related elements of your story in order to relieve you of finding yourself in a dynamic life.
How can I calm my anxiety when I'm alone?;So this is the technique I have been using for the last 50 years. It's all based on breathing. 1- Slow and deep abdominal breathing throughout the exercise. 2- You try to mentally project on your forehead a view that reminds you of a happy time in your life, the goal is to mobilize your mind and "keep it from wandering". 3- You start from the tip of your feet and work your way up to your ears by contracting and relaxing every muscle you find. There you are relaxed and remain in slow breathing for two or three minutes. If you are lying down, you will sleep fast. This exercise is very simple, after a few days it will become reflex and well coordinated. Normally you regain control of your body and your life. Try on the Internet there are lots of relaxation exercises, this one is the simplest and I assure you that it works. I hope I have contributed to a little more control of yourself in a calm and gentle way.
How can I calm my anxiety when I'm alone?;Your resistance to stress, which has an important biological support, also requires a healthy lifestyle: a healthy and balanced diet, the practice of sports and a good sleep. A good relational network and a good work/leisure balance will also be very useful to you. I also invite you to reconsider the decisions to be taken, one after the other, use writing for this, a notebook for example, which will give trace to your reflection. You will be able to build up your reflection in this way and thus establish the best action plans. This will calm you down and you will regain control of your life. Become more confident in a life that is generous, this mental attitude will open up more favorable and fulfilling possibilities for you. It will also generate greater mental and physical energy. New opportunities are opening up for you, rejoice!
How do you help someone with agoraphobia?;First of all, make sure it is agoraphobia. The diagnosis is a matter for a specialist and not a rough search on the Internet or in a medical book. Similarly, the management will be done with a shrink. This is the first step in alleviating the girl's suffering and that of your friend.
How do you help someone with agoraphobia?;Agoraphobia is very disabling because it often locks people in their homes and creates a real withdrawal. The first step to get out of any type of phobia is the will to... The results will only be positive if your friend's daughter sincerely wishes to get out of this "hell". This agoraphobia can also be the consequence of a deeper evil often creating a significant self-confidence problem. A therapist can accompany your friend's daughter on the road to rebirth. Talk to her about it and see if she is open to consulting a professional. It's a great way to continue on your life's path.

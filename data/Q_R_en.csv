What are the differences between LOC and causal attribution?;"First of all the LOC (Locus of Control) corresponds to a general anticipation, an a priori expectation. While an Attribution is an explanation, a judgment made a posteriori on a very specific event.

What could I do when my girlfriend left me after 10 years of living together?;Ten years of living together can only make a difference, regardless of your age. But in a couple, each one evolves, sometimes together and sometimes the opposite. Your friend seems to have taken a direction of freedom.

And you will see things differently. Sincerely.

Is my dream premonitory?;Nothing can be premonitory, the dream is a safety valve for our body.
Why can't I forget my perverted narcissistic ex-boyfriend?;To begin with, I think that a statement in the gendarmerie should be made for assault and battery in order to protect you but also to protect others. Secondly, I think that this relationship must have provoked a certain amount of physical and psychological fear. In my case, I strongly advise you to consult a psychologist who will tell you how to manage your fears and the fears that are ingrained in you. You can also do hypnosis sessions to let go of all this but before doing so, you should think about consulting a psychologist in order to manage all this.
Why can't I forget my perverted narcissistic ex-boyfriend?;In a relationship between two people and when there is a pervert it is always very important to find out why your relationship is in balance. Indeed as of the first unacceptable behaviors for you, you should have left and you remained to support even more, thus that has a direction for you even if you feel victim, even if you are in a form of masochism, this man came to bring you something in the relation. it is by understanding that that you will be able to leave it and not reproduce again elsewhere.
Why can't I forget my perverted narcissistic ex-boyfriend?;It's quite normal that you don't forget as quickly as that a relationship that must have been traumatic. It seduces you, gets you a job, and then puts you through extreme violence. I hope you have thought about reporting it on the dating site, so that it doesn't continue to be abusive. You now have to rebuild yourself, you have a lot of psychic work to do. You were certainly very afraid when he mistreated you, afraid of dying perhaps when he blocked your breathing! I strongly encourage you to contact either a victim support service at a court or a psychotherapist to get out of the nightmare he made you live with your passive complicity. Do not remain alone with these memories!
How can I restore my man's confidence?;Narcissistic perverts are manipulative, so they know how to seduce you and turn the relationship into something addictive. This may be why you find it hard to forget and have nightmares. I don't know if it's him or you who broke up, but it's a good thing. Be proud of yourself. There's only one thing to do with narcissistic perverts: run away. He may try to come back, and at that point it will be important for you to be strong so you can ignore or push him away. If you feel guilty, know that under no circumstances are you guilty about what happened. 
How can I restore my man's confidence?;Restoring trust to a person means first and foremost trusting him, loving him, adoring him, empowering him, knowing how to forgive, discussing, finding solutions. Act in his interests and your own.
How can I restore my man's confidence?;You seem to be so much in love that you lose your autonomy. And moreover, the first love is not insignificant. Also, you are afraid of losing it. It is important that you find other interests in order to regain your autonomy and your personality (i.e. to live with him but not for him), and to detach yourself from your fear of losing him. If you have been together for 9 years, it means that there is love and that your relationship is serious. But by dint of fear, your behavior, against your conscious will, will eventually drive him away. Go out with friends, enjoy yourself (shopping, fitness, sports, going out...) and if he wants to see his family, do you have to go with him? Make yourself desired to be happy to find yourself afterwards. He needs to see other people and try to understand him on this point. You are young, there are many things to do and you have your life ahead of you. Don't be in too much of a hurry and don't be too impatient. Take your time. To help you let go and feel better about yourself, try meditation, sophrology, yoga... you may find a method that works for you. And if, despite your efforts, this relationship ends, tell yourself that it's not over. There is always something positive in what life gives us, only we don't always see it right away. Have confidence in yourself and in life.
How to react to a person who has paranoid delusions?;If the situation with your friend is bothering you, you need to distance yourself for now. Is this the first time this has happened to her? In any case, if she is in a delirium of persecution or paranoia, do not attack her. You can also talk about it with family and friends to find out if they have been through the same situation before? In any case, don't play into her hands: don't attack her and don't make her feel guilty. If she starts to physically assault you again, call the fire department, they will be able to accompany her to the emergency services nearest her home. Keep me informed.
How to react to a person who has paranoid delusions?;Do you live in or near a major city? If so, and your friend refuses to see a psychiatrist, I recommend that you look up the phone number of SOS Psychiatry, keep it with you and call as soon as a crisis arises. You will then benefit from a home visit, be less exposed, and contact will finally be established.
What are the associations that help paranoid families?;I don't know of any association that deals specifically with paranoid patients or their spouses, and is it prudent or appropriate to advertise (or advertise) under such a name knowing the potential of some of these patients? You can find within associations helping patients and their families in your region (in France?) or on the net you can find interesting sites mostly Canadian dealing with problems of the couple and others for the children of subjects suffering from these disorders you can for example consult the Quebec site.
What are the associations that help paranoid families?;Some choices in life are very difficult and painful. You are in that situation today. Your husband has been under the care of a psychiatrist for many years but he only takes his medication when he feels like it. This shows that your husband has no awareness of his illness: he doesn't realize the seriousness of his paranoia. You are torn between your love for him and the care you can still provide him. This is really admirable on your part, but I think you should listen to the psychiatrist's advice when he tells you to distance yourself. Protect yourself and your children. At the same time, find a professional to support you psychologically because you are going through a difficult time. Also get closer to. Close bones. Speaking of associations, get closer to associations of people with a loved one who has a mental illness. They will be able to provide you with support.
What are the associations that help paranoid families?;Do you know Unafam? Unafam is an association recognized as being of public utility, which welcomes, listens, supports, trains, informs and accompanies the families and the entourage of people living with psychic disorders.

Furthermore, I encourage you to look for psychotherapeutic support for yourself in order to help you face a situation that is objectively difficult.
What should I do if I am anxious by nature?;Anxiety if it becomes chronic can be a real torture in everyday life. To relax, you can try relaxation (breathing, massage, meditation), listen to music, practice a sport activity, go for a walk in nature, change the decor of your home. You can also do psychotherapy sessions that will allow you to understand the origin of your anxieties, how to make your emotions flow and find solutions to find a better well-being, that is to say to find a taste for life, the pleasure of doing activities, to take time for yourself.
How can I have a strong character like my friends?;"You ask the question of ""strength of character"" in the sense of the ability to assert oneself, to affirm one's character, to have ""the strength to defend one's opinion, one's choice. Your options"" even if it means making them accepted, if not imposed on the group, or at least sticking to your personal options without feeling ""obliged"" to follow the options of others or to erase yourself in front of them. This requires the ""audacity"" to express yourself without fearing in advance the perhaps critical opinion of others. Also the courage and audacity to believe in the validity of your opinions and your choices without holding them in advance as inferior to those of others: this requires confidence in oneself, in its intrinsic value, the strength of audacity to express one's opinion without retreating before the POSSIBLE existence of one or more different opinions, the audacity of the strength to argue and try to convince without weakening. These traits of ""assertiveness"" are grouped together under the term ""assertiveness"" and you are among those who have a problem at this level. Unfortunately, you do not indicate anything about your age, your activity or your life context. In principle, with the help of a shrink, who is willingly a hypnotherapist, you could correct your difficulties, which can be assimilated to a handicap in relational and social life: this can be corrected by making an effort on yourself, guided by the therapist, at least if you are willing to make this effort. I can't tell you more because I don't have enough data."
How can I have a strong character like my friends?;Are you a teenager? Sometimes it's difficult to impose yourself. But I think, above all, that their character is too strong compared to you, that you feel inferior to them. It would be better to have other friends who are more like you, and with whom you can talk about anything without fear of their reactions. By staying with them, you will continue to suffer, and to be a person that you are not... It's a shame, frankly.
Why don't I have any memories of my childhood?;it can happen that one has the impression to have forgotten everything of the period of childhood - it is due to several factors especially of the emotional series - but it is difficult to answer you by not knowing anything about you apart from your age, background, profession, family situation and life of possible couple.

Perhaps there are still other clues...
Why don't I have any memories of my childhood?;No memories? Or no visual memories? Sometimes it's easier to find sensations, smells, touches, than to see scenes again. Especially when you feel worried, as you do. If necessary, consult a hypnotherapist in order to intensify the tenuous threads that connect you to your childhood. The unconscious never forgets anything...
Why don't I have any memories of my childhood?;Many people have what are called defensive mechanisms that prevent them from recovering their memories, which does not allow them to access their traumas that lead to various problems in their lives. In therapy, the use of hypnosis often helps to reduce resistance and thus to bring back memories.
Why don't I have any memories of my childhood?;Forgetfulness is an ability of our brain. Sometimes we forget where we put our keys when we hold them in our hands. The brain plays tricks on us! I say capacity because it allows us to free the system (the hard disk) to store other important information. Of course, some may not be immediately accessible or not at all. This is often characterized by the way and intensity in which we experienced the situation. I'm sure you remember your last burst of laughter, don't you? So to conclude, it's a matter of identifying the most beautiful memories you've experienced lately, and others again, just to see that everything is going well and that your emotions bring you back unconditionally to your most ingrained memories!
I would like to know a precise definition of cognitive disorders.;Cognitive disorders are simply disorders of cognition, i.e. knowledge or information that affects the memory, but not only. 
How to become mature at 16?;Each person is unique. You're wondering how to become more mature at 16. How old is your boyfriend? What are the elements or facts that make him think you are immature? Is it in the way you talk, dress and behave with others? Is it the way you make decisions, do things, laugh? Is it in the way you love him? At 16 years old, a certain immaturity is not extraordinary because you are still in your teens while you are moving towards adulthood. In a couple, everyone evolves differently but too much difference can destroy the couple. In your situation, your boyfriend seems much more mature than you, so he has different expectations of you, he expects you to behave like an adult. Your immaturity must create discomfort for him towards others and perhaps shame. So try to change your behavior: be more of an adult than a child. This will avoid distension within your couple.

Existential death anxiety, how to get rid of it?;Anxiety is often linked to the fact that it is difficult to live in the present. Anticipation, which is a normal activity of the brain, with another part looking for solutions to a whole series of hypothetical hypotheses, can become pervasive and harmful. It doesn't matter what logical reasons and explanations you can come up with. Hypnosis, which addresses the unconscious mind, is perfectly suited to solving this type of difficulty.

How do you help someone with agoraphobia?;First of all, make sure it is agoraphobia. The diagnosis is a matter for a specialist and not a rough search on the Internet or in a medical book. Similarly, the management will be done with a shrink. This is the first step in alleviating the girl's suffering and that of your friend.

The first step to get out of any type of phobia is the will to... The results will only be positive if your friend's daughter sincerely wishes to get out of this ""hell"".

How to get rid of bad thoughts?;"What you are describing manifests an old and familiar suffering which escapes you, which hides, but which acts in the shadows, through these ""bad thoughts"" from which you are suffering. In order for them to leave you, it is necessary to take a therapeutic approach with a professional able to listen to what escapes you, the unconscious, and which is based on what you experienced in early childhood. It will be about talking about your early childhood, what was experienced by your mother during pregnancy, about family history, and about finding out what was difficult and painful when you were very young. You will gradually discover this kind of reflex, unconscious, which locks you up. As you speak and be truly listened to, these ideas will gradually fade away and give way to the recognition of the good things that life gives you to experience."

But his criticisms are always explicit, embellished with disadvantageous comparisons. Not enough to feed self-esteem ... And you should question your attachment style (dependent?). You might want to shed some light on these issues in therapy to improve your image a little.
My friend is sleeping with his 9 year old daughter, is this normal?;"No, it's not good for your companion to sleep with his daughter, it's an incestuous relationship, where everyone finds something that they like, but which is false: his daughter is not his companion. She is not in a girl's place, she is in a false place that will prevent her from building a healthy and peaceful relational life, with boys and then with men. You are clairvoyant, you are in a place of humiliation, as if you were a mistress that your companion leaves behind for an incestuous relationship. Your relationship to you 2 also becomes false, as your companion refuses to listen to you.
"
Why can't I figure out what I want.;Doubts, prospects, forgetting who we are and our resources are even more topical questions. Faced with this, a moment to reflect, take stock and listen to yourself and with advice may be necessary. With kindness, empathy and without judgment, I also consult visio (Doctolib): this allows great discretion and confidentiality, without moving and at times when you are available.
I would like help with my emotions;Not being able to cry is not necessarily a sign that you are a monster. You may be cut off from your emotions for one reason or another. Probably for protection. Sometimes some men forbid themselves to cry in order to appear stronger, for example ... Anyway you have established this defense system, perhaps not to suffer, to protect yourself, Crying can be scary but also good. Not being able to cry is painful. And then, sadness can also manifest itself in other ways than crying. Moreover, when faced with death, everyone reacts in a different way. There is not only sadness as an emotion, but also anger, shame, fear, guilt ... which moreover you may experience when you realize that you are unable to cry. There are also other emotions like joy, love, relief.
Misophonia: where can it come from?;"I am inclined to think that you have done some kind of reflex conditioning ""the feelings which have now become automatic when I sit at the table"". Like a kind of learning that sticks to the idea that at the table you feel this, as we have insomniacs who cannot sleep on the sofa or the armchair and no longer in their bed because when they go to their bed they have associated the idea that in bed they cannot sleep, as a kind of reflex. With the help of a professional, in addition to working on the cause of misophonia and what it means to you, you could work on breaking this automatic mechanism."
I have problems with my roommate;Too bad we don't know if you are a boy or a girl as it may matter. Indeed, if you are male, your roommate can project more onto you what bothers her and what she feels for her boyfriend. Indeed, it is easier to be in a bad mood against you than against him! If you are a girl, you are also the one who realizes the situation, who witnesses the repercussion of what you call miseries and you witness their impact. In a way, you represent a bit of her Jiminy Criquet, who shows her what does not work but that she refuses to hear because it is painful and shows that what she is experiencing does not make her blossom.
Am I asexual or do I have a blockage?;Too bad you do not specify your age. If you've never managed to feel sexually fulfilled before, it's time to see a therapist. Penetration is often badly experienced for different reasons, religious, cultural, trauma from the past, etc ... The hypnotherapy that I practice is relevant to go to the source of your blockage. Only verbal therapy will not be of much interest.
Problem with fire;Fire has a fascinating side to the extent that it is an element that lives its life, that it is difficult to control, because from a simple spark it can become devastating. He faces the risk that we think we can manage but which in the end can turn into a nightmare. This is a bit like what happens for someone who plays roulette at the Casino, he knows that he can lose everything, but has such an adrenaline rush when he plays, that it becomes enjoyable. And besides, do we not say “Play with fire”…. to clearly show this part of pleasure and fear which accompanies this fascination. To come back to your son, perhaps there is there this illusion of power, of power, over this element of nature that he would like to control - fire - but at the same time this fear which excites and gives some pleasure. Here is a line of thought to be explored with a professional.
My mom's illness, I feel guilty;You have worn a lot. You have given a lot. Today you are saturated, exhausted. You took on the role of the adult when you were a child. The roles have been reversed and it is time for everyone to take their place. Your mother is an adult. There are bodies to help the sick or disabled. Social worker, doctor, psychiatrist ... I invite you to delegate, that your mother takes care of herself and especially that you take care of yourself! Psychology has done you good so go on with the same person or another. You need support.
How can we help if one of our loved ones is psychologically ill?;Who is this close to you? son, brother?

My love situation prevents me from moving forward;You need to recreate a space for communication and a strong bond of trust with your partner if you want to continue together.
Adolescence is the important glue for adult life.;It is true that adolescence is a turning point in a person's life. Bodily, hormonal, psychological, social changes… but nothing is definitely over. It is a period of construction with ups and downs. And so we cannot speak in binary terms, that is to say that if it goes well - OR - badly the game will be made for the rest of life. Not only do all the transitions exist but when things get hard at certain times, if you feel that you are losing your footing a little, it is always possible to be accompanied by family, relatives, teachers…. a shrink… .in order to be an actor in one's own story rather than a victim of what one has trouble managing. Certainly, depending on how adolescence is experienced, the personality will be affected. But the environment, the chance of encounters, individual choices, joys, sorrows, all this contributes to the construction of the personality in a flexible and responsible manner.
Stress, anxiety, guilt, desire to disappear;Do you have any idea how you could disappear from the world without dying?

How to forget an obsession?;Trying to chase thoughts away is a process that tends to bring them back. The more we want to suppress them, the more they come back, and occupy the mind, this is what we call ruminations. Paradoxically, the way to stop these ruminations would be to think about them and express them clearly. This can either be by sharing them with someone, who may be an expert, or by writing them down. Eritrotherapy is a concrete and easily accessible solution for ruminating problems.
Psychologist lacking professionalism?;You were very disappointed, but I wonder how you could not have been given what you are saying. You hate misunderstandings, and you are concerned about being well listened to and heard, and above all not to be judged (and this is quite normal). But you yourself are constantly judging every word from your shrink. You are constantly interpreting what she is saying. In fact, you are suspicious of the other, you expect a lot from them. In front of you, it seems very difficult to be natural and spontaneous, and therefore sincere. Everything is monitored. Of course, you don't want to. You are in great fear of the other, hence your attention to the smallest details and your always negative interpretations. The difficulty will be for you to agree to let go of control a little to accept that the other can come to you without constantly feeling judged.
Talking about intimacy issues to your psychologist;If your problem today is rooted in your past, dealing with the trauma (s) from the past will calm the present quite naturally so you don't need to talk about your sexuality today right now. Your physical pains your inability to be touched even in a friendly way is a protective reaction so that what was hurt in the past is not hurt again in the present. When you feel healed of your past, at ease you can tell your inner protectors that they no longer need to be so determined in your present and that they have nothing to fear from future relationships.
Probably Autistic but I still doubt;"This type of problem can be worked on in therapy by adapted methods (with therapists accustomed to taking charge of this type of suffering, whether it is a kind of ""social phobia"" or a consequence of the Asperger syndrome more or less important). .. and which allow a better adaptation of the person to the vagaries of life in society, with others."
Forgive infidelity and lying;In all of our relationships, at least the most meaningful, the other is a mirror of who we are. The discovery of this old infidelity has reactivated the wound of betrayal that you have worn for a long time (early childhood). The fact that she is still so vivid shows that she is not healed, you still have a hard time trusting, even though your bonds seem to have strengthened and that at the time, if I understood correctly, you were not yourself very sure of your feelings and your wish to engage with this man. It would be important for you to go explore your past to understand how you have built yourself and then learn to trust yourself so that you can trust afterwards. We see through your idea of ​​registering on a dating site, your desire to please other men, that you greatly need to be reassured that you can please, be loved.
No longer feel phobia towards vaccinations or injections?;The fear of needles is one of the most common phobias, and it can be treated!

Depression in the BLACK community;It is always very painful to feel the suspicion or even the judgment of one's family. But it is not the family, nor the community in your life that can really help you out of depression.
I want to have confidence in myself, and control my emotions.;Why do you want to fight against your nature? You have ups and downs like everyone else, emotions being guided by hormones, themselves influenced by seasonality, brightness etc. If you do not have a depressive attack with the desire to suicide, you are probably prone to depressive episodes which can be managed in two complementary ways: medication to help you sleep, for example, and taking in psychological charge.
Can I regain the feeling of being happy?;Humans are incredibly resilient, there is no doubt that you can regain your zest for life! Obviously your traumas are blocking you.

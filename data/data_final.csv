drug;results of stopping terazosin?;The effect of withdrawal of terazosin therapy in patients with mild to moderate hypertension was assessed in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. All patients had demonstrated a stable blood pressure response to terazosin prior to withdrawal of the drug. Patients were randomly assigned either to continue treatment with terazosin at a previously established dose that had brought blood pressure under control (dose range: 1 to 40 mg daily) or to receive a matching placebo. At the end of a six- or eight-week withdrawal period, placebo-treated patients experienced mean increases of 7.3 and 12.4 mm Hg in supine diastolic blood pressure (studies M81-020 and M81-028 site 1, respectively). These increases were significantly greater than those observed for patients who continued to receive terazosin. Similar results were observed in other blood pressure variables. Withdrawal of terazosin was accompanied by a significant weight loss (2.8 and 3.6 pounds in studies M81-020 and M81-028, respectively). There were no clinically significant changes in pulse rates, physical examinations, laboratory test results, or electrocardiograms. Headache was the most common adverse experience reported by those who received placebo during the drug withdrawal period. These studies demonstrate that withdrawal of terazosin therapy is associated with an increase in supine diastolic blood pressure, often to hypertensive levels, without signs of a withdrawal syndrome.

Excessive doses of peppermint oil can be toxic.     Possible side effects of peppermint oil include allergic reactions and heartburn.

When the undiluted essential oil is used for health purposes, only a few drops are used.     Side effects of applying peppermint oil to the skin can include skin rashes and irritation. Peppermint oil should not be applied to the face or chest of infants or young children because serious side effects may occur if they inhale the menthol in the oil.     No harmful effects of peppermint leaf tea have been reported. However, the long-term safety of consuming large amounts of peppermint leaf is unknown.

Do not change the dose of your pain relief medication without talking to your doctor first.

Also, pain medications should never be shared with anyone else. Only your health care professional can decide if a prescription pain medication is safe for someone.

Here are other key points to remember.

With acetaminophen:

Taking a higher dose than recommended will not provide more relief and can be dangerous.
Too much can lead to liver damage and death. Risk for liver damage may be increased in people who drink three or more alcoholic beverages a day while using acetaminophen-containing medicines.
Be cautious when giving acetaminophen to children. Infant drop medications can be significantly stronger than regular children's medications.

Use of NSAIDs can also cause kidney damage. This risk may increase in people who are over 60 years of age, are taking a diuretic (a drug that increases the excretion of urine), have high blood pressure, heart disease, or pre-existing kidney disease.

With opioids:
Use of opioids can lead to drowsiness. Do not drive or use any machinery that may injure you, especially when you first start the medication.The dose of an opioid pain medication that is safe for you could be high enough to cause an overdose and death in someone else, especially children."

drug;what is insulin and glycogen;"Insulin and glucagon work in what’s called a negative feedback loop. During this process, one event triggers another, which triggers another, and so on, to keep your blood sugar levels balanced.

How insulin works
During digestion, foods that contain carbohydrates are converted into glucose. Most of this glucose is sent into your bloodstream, causing a rise in blood glucose levels. This increase in blood glucose signals your pancreas to produce insulin.

The insulin tells cells throughout your body to take in glucose from your bloodstream. As the glucose moves into your cells, your blood glucose levels go down. Some cells use the glucose as energy. Other cells, such as in your liver and muscles, store any excess glucose as a substance called glycogen. Your body uses glycogen for fuel between meals.

||

How glucagon works
Glucagon works to counterbalance the actions of insulin.

About four to six hours after you eat, the glucose levels in your blood decrease, triggering your pancreas to produce glucagon. This hormone signals your liver and muscle cells to change the stored glycogen back into glucose. These cells then release the glucose into your bloodstream so your other cells can use it for energy.

This whole feedback loop with insulin and glucagon is constantly in motion. It keeps your blood sugar levels from dipping too low, ensuring that your body has a steady supply of energy."

drug;why would my urine test be negative for benzodiazepines when i take ativan;Common limitations exist for screening benzodiazepines when using traditional immunoassay (IA) tests. IA testing for benzodiazepines often targets nordiazepam and oxazepam to measure whether an antibody-antigen response occurs, resulting in a positive or negative test result. Other benzodiazepine compounds are tested for their ability to cross react with the target drug in an IA technique. In other words, low cross-reactivity of other drugs can result in false negatives for the other benzodiazepines. || Some commonly prescribed drugs have limited cross-reactivity. For example, lorazepam and 7-aminoclonazepam, the primary metabolite of clonazepam, have limited cross-reactivity with traditional IAs due to their molecular structures. Therefore, it is not uncommon for a laboratory to obtain a “negative” IA result for lorazepam and 7-aminoclonazepam that is indeed positive once confirmation testing with a mass spectrometer (MS) is performed.

Dose Selection— SEROQUEL should generally be administered with an initial dose of 25 mg twice daily, with increases in total daily dose of 25 mg - 50 mg divided in two or three doses on the second and third day, as tolerated, to a total dose range of 300 mg to 400 mg daily by the fourth day. Further dosage adjustments, if indicated, should generally occur at intervals of not less than 2 days, as steady-state for SEROQUEL would not be achieved for approximately 1-2 days in the typical patient. When dosage adjustments are necessary, dose increments/decrements of 25 mg - 50 mg divided twice daily are recommended. Most efficacy data with SEROQUEL were obtained using three times daily dosing regimens, but in one controlled trial 225 mg given twice per day was also effective. 

Efficacy in schizophrenia was demonstrated in a dose range of 150 mg/day to 750 mg/day in the clinical trials supporting the effectiveness of SEROQUEL. In a dose response study, doses above 300 mg/day were not demonstrated to be more efficacious than the 300 mg/day dose. In other studies, however, doses in the range of 400 mg/day - 500 mg/day appeared to be needed. The safety of doses above 800 mg/day has not been evaluated in clinical trials."

drug;is it nessasary to ween off of cymbalta before starting effexor?;Switching from one antidepressant to another is frequently indicated due to an inadequate treatment response or unacceptable adverse effects. All antidepressant switches must be carried out cautiously and under close observation. Conservative switching strategies involve gradually tapering the first antidepressant followed by an adequate washout period before the new antidepressant is started. This can take a long time and include periods of no treatment with the risk of potentially life-threatening exacerbations of illness. Clinical expertise is needed for more rapid or cross-taper switching as drug toxicity, including serotonin syndrome, may result from inappropriate co-administration of antidepressants. Some antidepressants must not be combined. Antidepressants can cause withdrawal syndromes if discontinued abruptly after prolonged use. Relapse and exacerbation of depression can also occur.

drug;how to stop taking xanax;"Because of the danger of withdrawal, abrupt discontinuation of treatment should be avoided (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE). In all patients, dosage should be reduced gradually when discontinuing therapy or when decreasing the daily dosage. Although there are no systematically collected data to support a specific discontinuation schedule, it is suggested that the daily dosage be decreased by no more than 0.5 mg every three days. Some patients may require an even slower dosage reduction. In any case, reduction of dose must be undertaken under close supervision and must be gradual. If significant withdrawal symptoms develop, the previous dosing schedule should be reinstituted and, only after stabilization, should a less rapid schedule of discontinuation be attempted. In a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients which compared this recommended taper schedule with a slower taper schedule, no difference was observed between the groups in the proportion of patients who tapered to zero dose; however, the slower schedule was associated with a reduction in symptoms associated with a withdrawal syndrome. It is suggested that the dose be reduced by no more than 0.5 mg every 3 days, with the understanding that some patients may benefit from an even more gradual discontinuation. Some patients may prove resistant to all discontinuation regimens."

drug;how to stop using estradiol transdermal system patch;There's no limit on how long you can take HRT, but talk to your GP about the duration of treatment they recommend. Most women stop taking it once their menopausal symptoms pass, which is usually after a few years. When you decide to stop, you can choose to do so suddenly or gradually. Gradually decreasing your HRT dose is usually recommended because it's less likely to cause your symptoms to come back in the short term. Contact your GP if you have symptoms that persist for several months after you stop HRT, or if you have particularly severe symptoms. You may need to start HRT again.
drug;how to stop taking bisoprolol;Abrupt Cessation of Therapy: Exacerbation of angina pectoris, and, in some instances, myocardial infarction or ventricular arrhythmia, have been observed in patients with coronary artery disease following abrupt cessation of therapy with beta-blockers. Such patients should, therefore, be cautioned against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physician's advice. Even in patients without overt coronary artery disease, it may be advisable to taper therapy with BISOPROLOL FUMARATE over approximately one week with the patient under careful observation. If withdrawal symptoms occur, BISOPROLOL FUMARATE therapy should be reinstituted, at least temporarily.

drug;"what is the difference between gabbentibe lyrica ""?"" for pain";Though pregabalin and gabapentin have somewhat similar pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, there are clearly significant differences. Overall, pregabalin has more predictable pharmacokinetics, and it also shows a stronger binding affinity to its target receptor, increased potency, and a steeper dose-response curve in neuropathic pain that does not plateau over recommended dosing levels. A few studies have found that pregabalin has fewer side effects and may be more efficacious for neuropathic pain than gabapentin. Several studies reviewing conversion of gabapentin to pregabalin predict that a rough ratio for conversion is about 6:1 gabapentin to pregabalin. In addition, a direct switch from gabapentin to pregabalin seems to be well tolerated, making the conversion simple. Clinicians should note that pregabalin has various pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic advantages over gabapentin, and a conversion between the 2 medications is often well tolerated.

drug;what the interaction between trimethoprim blood pressure medication;Hyperkalemia was first recognized during high-dose trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole therapy for P. jiroveci, but it is increasingly appreciated as a potential complication at doses usually prescribed. … Hyperkalemia tends to develop after several days of therapy,32,34 and the risk factors predictably include … treatment with other drugs that inhibit kaliuresis such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers36 and spironolactone.37 A recent population-based case–control study involving 439 677 patients taking ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers found a sevenfold increased risk of hospital admission for hyperkalemia among those taking trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole compared with those taking other antibiotics used for urinary tract infections.36 We suggest that physicians monitor patients for hyperkalemia following a few days of trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole treatment at a standard dose, especially patients with impaired renal function, which may include older patients, those with diabetes or AIDS, and those also taking ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers or spironolactone.
drug;what antidepressants are best for someone with a heart arrhythmia;A research team at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital has verified that several antidepressants may increase the risk of a potentially dangerous heart rhythm disturbance (arrhythmia). By examining the electrocardiograms (ECGs) of more than 38,000 people taking 11 different antidepressants, they confirmed that higher doses of citalopram (Celexa), amitriptyline (Elavil), and escitalopram (Lexapro) were associated with a slight disruption of the electrical function of the heart. This delay as seen on an ECG is known as a prolonged Q-T interval, and it is a risk factor for an arrhythmia that causes sudden death. Although the majority of people with this ECG abnormality never develop an arrhythmia, the researchers cautioned that people taking these antidepressants should discuss the risk with their doctor. The researchers emphasized that no one with a history of arrhythmias should start taking these medications. Instead, such a patient might try one of the antidepressants that do not increase the Q-T interval: fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), sertraline (Zoloft), or buproprion (Wellbutrin). The study was published Jan. 29, 2013, in the journal BMJ.
drug;how does it take phentermine to clear a drug screen?;Since phentermine has a similar structure to amphetamines, a urine drug screen can test positive for amphetamines. This will signal the need for a confirmatory test, which will then show that it was phentermine and not amphetamine or methamphetamine. The original result will then be ruled a false positive. If you have a prescription for phentermine, you should disclose that to the testing lab so your results can be appropriately interpreted. Phentermine is likely to be detected in the urine for one to four days after a dose, up to 24 hours in the blood, and up to one month in hair tests. The amount of phentermine detected in tests and how long it stays in your system is dependent on a number of factors. These include your age, the dose and how long you've been taking it, and your metabolism. For instance, a person of average build and metabolism can expect phentermine to be present in urine for three to five days. It may be faster for someone of a small build or longer for an older person.

drug;"is peppermint oil safe in ""mouth wash?""";Peppermint oil appears to be safe when taken orally (by mouth) in the doses commonly used. Excessive doses of peppermint oil can be toxic.     Possible side effects of peppermint oil include allergic reactions and heartburn. Capsules containing peppermint oil are often enteric-coated to reduce the likelihood of heartburn. If enteric-coated peppermint oil capsules are taken at the same time as antacids, the coating can break down too quickly.     Like other essential oils, peppermint oil is highly concentrated. When the undiluted essential oil is used for health purposes, only a few drops are used.     Side effects of applying peppermint oil to the skin can include skin rashes and irritation. Peppermint oil should not be applied to the face or chest of infants or young children because serious side effects may occur if they inhale the menthol in the oil.     No harmful effects of peppermint leaf tea have been reported. However, the long-term safety of consuming large amounts of peppermint leaf is unknown.

drug;what is dopamine;Dopamine (DA, a contraction of 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine) is an organic chemical of the catecholamine and phenethylamine families that plays several important roles in the brain and body. It is an amine synthesized by removing a carboxyl group from a molecule of its precursor chemical L-DOPA, which is synthesized in the brain and kidneys. Dopamine is also synthesized in plants and most animals. In the brain, dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter—a chemical released by neurons (nerve cells) to send signals to other nerve cells. The brain includes several distinct dopamine pathways, one of which plays a major role in the motivational component of reward-motivated behavior. The anticipation of most types of rewards increases the level of dopamine in the brain,[2] and many addictive drugs increase dopamine release or block its reuptake into neurons following release. Other brain dopamine pathways are involved in motor control and in controlling the release of various hormones. These pathways and cell groups form a dopamine system which is neuromodulatory.

Dilatation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction, and coronary dilatation remains undefined.

drug;what is fluoride;"The mineral fluoride occurs naturally on earth and is released from rocks into the soil, water, and air. All water contains some fluoride. Usually, the fluoride level in water is not enough to prevent tooth decay; however, some groundwater and natural springs can have naturally high levels of fluoride. Fluoride has been proven to protect teeth from decay. Bacteria in the mouth produce acid when a person eats sugary foods. This acid eats away minerals from the tooth’s surface, making the tooth weaker and increasing the chance of developing cavities. Fluoride helps to rebuild and strengthen the tooth’s surface, or enamel. Water fluoridation prevents tooth decay by providing frequent and consistent contact with low levels of fluoride. By keeping the tooth strong and solid, fluoride stops cavities from forming and can even rebuild the tooth’s surface."

drug;is it safe to add peppermint essential oil in mouthwash?;Peppermint oil appears to be safe when taken orally (by mouth) in the doses commonly used. Excessive doses of peppermint oil can be toxic.     Possible side effects of peppermint oil include allergic reactions and heartburn. Capsules containing peppermint oil are often enteric-coated to reduce the likelihood of heartburn. If enteric-coated peppermint oil capsules are taken at the same time as antacids, the coating can break down too quickly.     Like other essential oils, peppermint oil is highly concentrated. When the undiluted essential oil is used for health purposes, only a few drops are used.     Side effects of applying peppermint oil to the skin can include skin rashes and irritation. Peppermint oil should not be applied to the face or chest of infants or young children because serious side effects may occur if they inhale the menthol in the oil.     No harmful effects of peppermint leaf tea have been reported. However, the long-term safety of consuming large amounts of peppermint leaf is unknown.

drug;1 mg ativan ccis a small does of ativan for adults?;Ativan (lorazepam) is administered orally. For optimal results, dose, frequency of administration, and duration of therapy should be individualized according to patient response. To facilitate this, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg tablets are available. The usual range is 2 to 6 mg/day given in divided doses, the largest dose being taken before bedtime, but the daily dosage may vary from 1 to 10 mg/day. For anxiety, most patients require an initial dose of 2 to 3 mg/day given two times a day or three times a day. For insomnia due to anxiety or transient situational stress, a single daily dose of 2 to 4 mg may be given, usually at bedtime. For elderly or debilitated patients, an initial dosage of 1 to 2 mg/day in divided doses is recommended, to be adjusted as needed and tolerated. The dosage of Ativan (lorazepam) should be increased gradually when needed to help avoid adverse effects.

drug;what is prochlorperazine;"For control of severe nausea and vomiting. 
For the treatment of schizophrenia.

Prochlorperazine is effective for the short-term treatment of generalized non-psychotic anxiety. However, prochlorperazine is not the first drug to be used in therapy for most patients with non-psychotic anxiety, because certain risks associated with its use are not shared by common alternative treatments (e.g., benzodiazepines).

When used in the treatment of non-psychotic anxiety, prochlorperazine should not be administered at doses of more than 20 mg per day or for longer than 12 weeks, because the use of prochlorperazine at higher doses or for longer intervals may cause persistent tardive dyskinesia that may prove irreversible (see WARNINGS).

The effectiveness of prochlorperazine as treatment for non-psychotic anxiety was established in 4-week clinical studies of outpatients with generalized anxiety disorder. This evidence does not predict that prochlorperazine will be useful in patients with other non-psychotic conditions in which anxiety, or signs that mimic anxiety, are found (e.g., physical illness, organic mental conditions, agitated depression, character pathologies, etc.).

Prochlorperazine has not been shown effective in the management of behavioral complications in patients with mental retardation."

This percentage excretion may fall as low as 1–5%/72 hours in individuals with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance below 10 mL/min.). Studies have shown no significant difference in serum half-life of doxycycline (range 18–22 hours) in individuals with normal and severely impaired renal function."
drug;"why ""shouldn't"" i take gemfibrozil while taking lovastatin?";"Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4: Lovastatin, like several other inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, is a substrate of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Certain drugs which inhibit this metabolic pathway can raise the plasma levels of lovastatin and may increase the risk of myopathy. These include itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, the macrolide antibiotics erythromycin and clarithromycin, the ketolide antibiotic telithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, boceprevir, telaprevir, the antidepressant nefazodone, or cobicistat-containing products. Combination of these drugs with lovastatin is contraindicated. If short-term treatment with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is unavoidable, therapy with lovastatin should be suspended during the course of treatment (see CONTRAINDICATIONS; PRECAUTIONS, DRUG INTERACTIONS).

Gemfibrozil: The combined use of lovastatin with gemfibrozil should be avoided.

Other lipid-lowering drugs (other fibrates or greater than or equal to 1 g/day of niacin): Caution should be used when prescribing other fibrates or lipid-lowering doses (greater than or equal to 1 g/day) of niacin with lovastatin, as these agents can cause myopathy when given alone. The benefit of further alterations in lipid levels by the combined use of lovastatin with other fibrates or niacin should be carefully weighed against the potential risks of these combinations."

drug;amiodarone for afibwhat are side effects;"Adverse reactions have been very common in virtually all series of patients treated with amiodarone for ventricular arrhythmias with relatively large doses of drug (400 mg/day and above), occurring in about three-fourths of all patients and causing discontinuation in 7 to 18%. The most serious reactions are pulmonary toxicity, exacerbation of arrhythmia, and rare serious liver injury (see “WARNINGS”), but other adverse effects constitute important problems. They are often reversible with dose reduction or cessation of amiodarone treatment. Most of the adverse effects appear to become more frequent with continued treatment beyond six months, although rates appear to remain relatively constant beyond one year. The time and dose relationships of adverse effects are under continued study.

Neurologic problems are extremely common, occurring in 20 to 40% of patients and including malaise and fatigue, tremor and involuntary movements, poor coordination and gait, and peripheral neuropathy; they are rarely a reason to stop therapy and may respond to dose reductions or discontinuation (see “PRECAUTIONS”). There have been spontaneous reports of demyelinating polyneuropathy.

Gastrointestinal complaints, most commonly nausea, vomiting, constipation, and anorexia, occur in about 25% of patients but rarely require discontinuation of drug. These commonly occur during high-dose administration (i.e., loading dose) and usually respond to dose reduction or divided doses.

Ophthalmic abnormalities including optic neuropathy and/or optic neuritis, in some cases progressing to permanent blindness, papilledema, corneal degeneration, photosensitivity, eye discomfort, scotoma, lens opacities, and macular degeneration have been reported (see “WARNINGS”).

Asymptomatic corneal microdeposits are present in virtually all adult patients who have been on drug for more than 6 months. Some patients develop eye symptoms of halos, photophobia, and dry eyes. Vision is rarely affected and drug discontinuation is rarely needed.

Dermatological adverse reactions occur in about 15% of patients, with photosensitivity being most common (about 10%). Sunscreen and protection from sun exposure may be helpful, and drug discontinuation is not usually necessary. Prolonged exposure to amiodarone occasionally results in a blue-gray pigmentation. This is slowly and occasionally incompletely reversible on discontinuation of drug but is of cosmetic importance only.

Cardiovascular adverse reactions, other than exacerbation of the arrhythmias, include the uncommon occurrence of congestive heart failure (3%) and bradycardia. Bradycardia usually responds to dosage reduction but may require a pacemaker for control. CHF rarely requires drug discontinuation. Cardiac conduction abnormalities occur infrequently and are reversible on discontinuation of drug."

drug;problems when stopping metformin, hair loss?;Metformin is often used to treat type 2 diabetes and may help some women with PCOS symptoms. It is not approved by the FDA to treat PCOS symptoms. Metformin improves insulin's ability to lower your blood sugar and can lower both insulin and androgen levels. After a few months of use, metformin may help restart ovulation, but it usually has little effect on acne and extra hair on the face or body. Recent research shows that metformin may have other positive effects, including lowering body mass and improving cholesterol levels.

Your doctor may prescribe a different medication to take when you have chest pain.
drug;how do antibiotics kill bacteria;"Have you ever wondered how antibiotics kill invading bacteria, while leaving human cells alone? Although there are similarities between bacteria and human cells, there are many differences as well. Antibiotics work by affecting things that bacterial cells have but human cells don’t.

For example, human cells do not have cell walls, while many types of bacteria do. The antibiotic penicillin works by keeping a bacterium from building a cell wall. Bacteria and human cells also differ in the structure of their cell membranes and the machinery they use to build proteins or copy DNA. Some antibiotics dissolve the membrane of just bacterial cells. Others affect protein-building or DNA-copying machinery that is specific to bacteria."

drug;"how long can you be on clopidogrel ""&"" aspirin combined for";"The following are key points to remember about the updated guideline on duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD):

The scope of this focused update is limited to addressing recommendations on duration of DAPT (aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).
Intensification of antiplatelet therapy, with the addition of a P2Y12 inhibitor to aspirin monotherapy, and prolongation of DAPT, necessitate a fundamental tradeoff between decreasing ischemic risk and increasing bleeding risk. Decisions regarding treatment with and duration of DAPT require a thoughtful assessment of the benefit/risk ratio, integration of study data, and patient preference.
Recommendations in the document apply specifically to duration of P2Y12 inhibitor therapy in patients with CAD treated with DAPT. Aspirin therapy should almost always be continued indefinitely in patients with CAD.
Lower daily doses of aspirin, including in patients treated with DAPT, are associated with lower bleeding complications and comparable ischemic protection compared with higher doses of aspirin. The recommended daily dose of aspirin in patients treated with DAPT is 81 mg (range 75–100 mg).
In patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) treated with DAPT after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation, P2Y12 inhibitor therapy with clopidogrel should be given for at least 6 months (Class I). In patients with SIHD treated with DAPT after bare-metal stent (BMS) implantation, P2Y12 inhibitor therapy (clopidogrel) should be given for a minimum of 1 month (Class I).
In patients with SIHD treated with DAPT after BMS or DES implantation who have tolerated DAPT without a bleeding complication and who are not at high bleeding risk (e.g., prior bleeding on DAPT, coagulopathy, oral anticoagulant use), continuation of DAPT with clopidogrel for longer than 1 month in patients treated with BMS or longer than 6 months in patients treated with DES may be reasonable (Class IIb).
In patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (non-ST elevation [NSTE]-ACS or ST elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI]) treated with DAPT after BMS or DES implantation, P2Y12 inhibitor therapy (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) should be given for at least 12 months (Class I).
In patients with ACS (NSTE-ACS or STEMI) treated with coronary stent implantation who have tolerated DAPT without a bleeding complication and who are not at high bleeding risk (e.g., prior bleeding on DAPT, coagulopathy, oral anticoagulant use), continuation of DAPT (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) for longer than 12 months may be reasonable (Class IIb). A new risk score (the “DAPT score”), derived from the Dual Antiplatelet Therapy study, may be useful for decisions about whether to continue (prolong or extend) DAPT in patients treated with coronary stent implantation.
In patients with ACS (NSTE-ACS or STEMI) treated with DAPT after coronary stent implantation and in patients with NSTE-ACS treated with medical therapy alone (without revascularization), it is reasonable to use ticagrelor in preference to clopidogrel for maintenance P2Y12 inhibitor therapy (Class IIa). Among those who are not at high risk for bleeding complications and who do not have a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, it is reasonable to choose prasugrel over clopidogrel for maintenance P2Y12 inhibitor therapy (Class IIa).
In patients with ACS (NSTE-ACS or STEMI) being treated with DAPT who undergo coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), P2Y12 inhibitor therapy should be resumed after CABG to complete 12 months of DAPT therapy after ACS (Class I).
In patients with STEMI treated with DAPT in conjunction with fibrinolytic therapy, P2Y12 inhibitor therapy (clopidogrel) should be continued for a minimum of 14 days and ideally at least 12 months (Class I).
Elective noncardiac surgery should be delayed 30 days after BMS implantation and optimally 6 months after DES implantation. In patients treated with DAPT after coronary stent implantation who must undergo surgical procedures that mandate the discontinuation of P2Y12 inhibitor therapy, it is recommended that aspirin be continued if possible and the P2Y12 platelet receptor inhibitor be restarted as soon as possible after surgery (Class I)."

drug;what does take drug with food mean?;"Some medicines need to be taken with or after food. Here are the 6 main reasons for this.
To reduce side effects of nausea or vomiting
It's better to take some medicines that can cause nausea or vomiting after a meal to reduce these side effects. Examples include allopurinol, bromocriptine and madopar.
To reduce side effects of stomach irritation, including indigestion, stomach inflammation or ulcers
Some medicines can irritate the stomach, and taking them with food will reduce this effect. Things such as biscuits or a sandwich, or a glass of milk, are usually enough. Examples include:
aspirin
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as diclofenac and ibuprofen
steroid medication (corticosteroids), such as prednisolone and dexamethasone
To treat problems such as heartburn, reflux or indigestion
Medicines called antacids are taken to prevent heartburn, reflux and indigestion, which usually occur when acid is produced as food enters your stomach. Therefore, these medicines are most effective if taken immediately after, or during, a meal.
To ensure the medicine is not washed away
Preparations such as mouthwashes, liquid nystatin, and miconazole gel for oral thrush or mouth ulcers must be used after meals. This is because eating food washes the medicine away too quickly.
To ensure the medicine is absorbed into the bloodstream properly
Some medications require food in the stomach and gut for the body to absorb them properly, such as the HIV medicines ritonavir, saquinavir and nelfinavir.
To help the body process the meal
Medicines for diabetes, if taken by mouth, should usually be taken around meal times to reduce blood sugar levels after eating and to avoid a very low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia).
Enzyme supplements, which can be used to help people with chronic pancreatitis, should also be taken with food to help the body process the meal."

drug;what is the max dose of oral iron supplement for senior citizen;"Table 1 lists the current iron RDAs for nonvegetarians. The RDAs for vegetarians are 1.8 times higher than for people who eat meat. This is because heme iron from meat is more bioavailable than nonheme iron from plant-based foods, and meat, poultry, and seafood increase the absorption of nonheme iron [5].

For infants from birth to 6 months, the FNB established an AI for iron that is equivalent to the mean intake of iron in healthy, breastfed infants.

drug;how often can a prescription of fentanyl be called in;"Fentanyl comes as four different transmucosal products and several other types of products. The medication in each product is absorbed differently by the body, so one product cannot be substituted for any other fentanyl product. If you are switching from one product to another, your doctor will prescribe a dose that is best for you.

A program has been set up for each fentanyl product to decrease the risk of using the medication. Your doctor will need to enroll in the program in order to prescribe fentanyl and you will need to have your prescription filled at a pharmacy that is enrolled in the program. As part of the program, your doctor will talk with you about the risks and benefits of using fentanyl and about how to safely use, store, and dispose of the medication. After you talk with your doctor, you will sign a form acknowledging that you understand the risks of using fentanyl and that you will follow your doctor's instructions to use the medication safely. Your doctor will give you more information about the program and how to get your medication and will answer any questions you have about the program and your treatment with fentanyl."
drug;how long does stomach take to empty for fosamax;"Absorption

Relative to an intravenous reference dose, the mean oral bioavailability of alendronate in women was 0.64% for doses ranging from 5 to 70 mg when administered after an overnight fast and two hours before a standardized breakfast. Oral bioavailability of the 10 mg tablet in men (0.59%) was similar to that in women when administered after an overnight fast and 2 hours before breakfast.

FOSAMAX 70 mg oral solution and FOSAMAX 70 mg tablet are equally bioavailable.

A study examining the effect of timing of a meal on the bioavailability of alendronate was performed in 49 postmenopausal women. Bioavailability was decreased (by approximately 40%) when 10 mg alendronate was administered either 0.5 or 1 hour before a standardized breakfast, when compared to dosing 2 hours before eating. In studies of treatment and prevention of osteoporosis, alendronate was effective when administered at least 30 minutes before breakfast.

Bioavailability was negligible whether alendronate was administered with or up to two hours after a standardized breakfast. Concomitant administration of alendronate with coffee or orange juice reduced bioavailability by approximately 60%."

drug;why take simvastatin;Simvastatin is used together with diet, weight-loss, and exercise to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke and to decrease the chance that heart surgery will be needed in people who have heart disease or who are at risk of developing heart disease. Simvastatin is also used to decrease the amount of fatty substances such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (''bad cholesterol'') and triglycerides in the blood and to increase the amount of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (''good cholesterol'') in the blood. Simvastatin may also be used to decrease the amount of cholesterol and other fatty substances in the blood in children and teenagers 10 to 17 years of age who have familial heterozygous hypercholesterolemia (an inherited condition in which cholesterol cannot be removed from the body normally). Simvastatin is in a class of medications called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). It works by slowing the production of cholesterol in the body to decrease the amount of cholesterol that may build up on the walls of the arteries and block blood flow to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body.

drug;what spices can be used while on warfarin;We found 58 different plants that may alter the blood haemostasis and anticoagulation with warfarin. The herbs that showed the greatest potential to interact with warfarin include garlic, ginger, ginkgo, St. John's wort, and ginseng, i.e. plants normally consumed as food and also used for therapeutic purposes. The interactions between drugs and herbs are varied because of the complex chemical matrix of plants. Mainly coumarins, quinones, xanthones, terpenes, lignans, and vitamin K showed significant influence on warfarin treatment. In general, these plants can potentiate the effect of warfarin by stimulating anticoagulation in multiple ways, and the clinical outcome associated with this interaction is the increase of bleeding risk.

Nonprescription aspirin is used to reduce fever and to relieve mild to moderate pain from headaches, menstrual periods, arthritis, colds, toothaches, and muscle aches. Nonprescription aspirin is also used to prevent heart attacks in people who have had a heart attack in the past or who have angina (chest pain that occurs when the heart does not get enough oxygen). Nonprescription aspirin is also used to reduce the risk of death in people who are experiencing or who have recently experienced a heart attack. Nonprescription aspirin is also used to prevent ischemic strokes (strokes that occur when a blood clot blocks the flow of blood to the brain) or mini-strokes (strokes that occur when the flow of blood to the brain is blocked for a short time) in people who have had this type of stroke or mini-stroke in the past. Aspirin will not prevent hemorrhagic strokes (strokes caused by bleeding in the brain). Aspirin is in a group of medications called salicylates. It works by stopping the production of certain natural substances that cause fever, pain, swelling, and blood clots.

drug;exercise restrictions with taking moxifloxacin?;"Fluoroquinolones, including Moxifloxacin Tablets, have been associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.2)] . This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon, and has also been reported with the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendons. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can occur within hours or days of starting moxifloxacin or as long as several months after completion of therapy. Tendinitis and tendon rupture can occur bilaterally.

The risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is increased in patients over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Other factors that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also occurred in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors. Discontinue Moxifloxacin Tablets immediately if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Patients should be advised to rest at the first sign of tendinitis or tendon rupture, and to contact their healthcare provider regarding changing to a non-quinolone antimicrobial drug. Avoid fluoroquinolones, including Moxifloxacin Tablets, in patients who have a history of tendon disorders or who have experienced tendinitis or tendon rupture [see Adverse Reactions"
drug;what are fat soluable vitamins.;"As is the case with all dietary supplements, the decision to use supplemental vitamins should not be taken lightly, says Vasilios Frankos, Ph.D., Director of FDA's Division of Dietary Supplement Programs.
""Vitamins are not dangerous unless you get too much of them,"" he says. ""More is not necessarily better with supplements, especially if you take fat-soluble vitamins.” For some vitamins and minerals, the National Academy of Sciences has established upper limits of intake (ULs) that it recommends not be exceeded during any given day.

When respondents were asked to rate the importance of 8 factors potentially affecting the decision to redose, more than half indicated that time after dose ingestion (59 [91%]), medication type (45 [69%]), patient status (39 [60%]), and visibility of medication in the vomitus (36 [55%]) were very important. Of the 53 respondents to the survey of health care professionals at other institutions, 16 (30%) indicated that their pediatric hospital or ward had a guideline on redosing in cases of vomiting after administration of oral medications. Most respondents (12/13 [92%]) stated that the guideline took into account the interval between initial ingestion and vomiting.
drug;influenza when received;"You should get a flu vaccine before flu begins spreading in your community. It takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies that protect against flu to develop in the body. CDC recommends that people get a flu vaccine by the end of October.  Getting vaccinated later, however, can still be beneficial and vaccination should continue to be offered throughout the flu season, even into January or later.

Children who need two doses of vaccine to be protected should start the vaccination process sooner, because the two doses must be given at least four weeks apart."
drug;prevnar >65what is this vaccine used for?;The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13 or Prevnar 13®) provides protection against the 13 serotypes responsible for most severe illness. The vaccine can also help prevent some ear infections. CDC recommends administering PCV13 as a four-dose series at 2, 4, 6, and 12 through 15 months of life. Research shows that this vaccine is very effective at preventing infection resulting from the serotypes contained in the vaccine. PCV13 should also be administered to all adults 65 years or older and to some adults 19 through 64 years of age with conditions that put them at increased risk for pneumococcal disease.
drug;what is clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionage cream;Clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream is a combination of an azole antifungal and corticosteroid and is indicated for the topical treatment of symptomatic inflammatory tinea pedis, tinea cruris, and tinea corporis due to Epidermophyton floccosum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and Trichophyton rubrum in patients 17 years and older.

drug;how often do you need a zoster vaccine?;"People 60 years of age or older should get shingles vaccine (Zostavax). They should get the vaccine whether or not they recall having had chickenpox, which is caused by the same virus as shingles. Studies show that more than 99% of Americans aged 40 and older have had chickenpox, even if they don’t remember getting the disease. There is no maximum age for getting shingles vaccine.

A new shingles vaccine called Shingrix was licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2017. CDC recommends that healthy adults 50 years and older get two doses of Shingrix, 2 to 6 months apart. Shingrix provides strong protection against shingles and PHN. Shingrix is the preferred vaccine, over Zostavax.

Even if you have had shingles, you can still receive shingles vaccine to help prevent future occurrences of the disease. There is no specific length of time you must wait after having shingles before receiving shingles vaccine, but generally you should make sure the shingles rash has disappeared before getting vaccinated. The decision on when to get vaccinated should be made with your healthcare provider."
drug;do prescription antacids help prevent reocurrence of arts?;"Antacids help to treat heartburn (indigestion). They work by neutralizing the stomach acid that causes heartburn.

You can buy many antacids without a prescription. Liquid forms work faster, but you may like tablets because they are easy to use.

All antacids work equally well, but they can cause different side effects. If you use antacids often and have problems with side effects, talk with your health care provider."
drug;how long can you take a steroid for arthritis;The length of time that patients will remain on steroid treatment will vary between patients (and rheumatologists). Some patients may only be given low-dose oral steroids for the first few months following diagnosis, while others may stay on steroids for longer. There is evidence to suggest that patients can experience a continued reduction in the progression of the disease from steroids for 1 to 2 years, but this will not be appropriate for everyone, so the decision will be made on an individual basis. These patients can also get symptom improvement for a year or two as a kind of 'beneficial side effect'.
drug;how long does marijuana stay in your system;"Marijuana, also known as cannabis or weed, is usually detectable in bodily fluids for 1 to 30 days after last use. As with other drugs, it may be detectable in hair for several months.

Marijuana detection windows depend on how much you smoke or ingest, as well as how often. In general, higher doses and more frequent use are associated with longer detection times.

drug;what is the protocol for adding insulin for type2 diabetics;"Why do I need to take insulin?
All people who have type 1 diabetes and some people who have type 2 diabetes need to take insulin to help control their blood sugar levels. The goal of taking insulin is to keep your blood sugar level in a normal range as much as possible. Keeping blood sugar in check helps you stay healthy. Insulin can’t be taken by mouth. It is usually taken by injection (a shot). It can also be taken by using an insulin pen or an insulin pump.

How often will I need to take insulin?
You and your doctor will develop a schedule that is right for you. Most people who have diabetes and take insulin need at least 2 insulin shots a day for good blood sugar control. Some people need 3 or 4 shots a day."

The usual dose of levofloxacin tablets are 250 mg or 500 mg administered orally every 24 hours, as indicated by infection and described in Table 1."
drug;what is insuline and glucagon;"Glucagon is a peptide hormone, produced by alpha cells of the pancreas. It works to raise the concentration of glucose and fatty acids in the bloodstream, and is considered to be the main catabolic hormone of the body.[3] It is also used as a medication to treat a number of health conditions. Its effect is opposite to that of insulin, which lowers the extracellular glucose.[4]
The pancreas releases glucagon when the concentration of insulin (and indirectly glucose) in the bloodstream falls too low. Glucagon causes the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose, which is released into the bloodstream.[5] High blood-glucose levels, on the other hand, stimulate the release of insulin. Insulin allows glucose to be taken up and used by insulin-dependent tissues. Thus, glucagon and insulin are part of a feedback system that keeps blood glucose levels stable. Glucagon increases energy expenditure and is elevated under conditions of stress.[6] Glucagon belongs to the secretin family of hormones."
drug;when to take loratadine;Hay fever typically worsens at night and feels most severe in the morning, when levels of symptom-triggering histamine are highest. Once-daily antihistamines, such as Claritin, reach their peak eight to 12 hours after you take them, so using them at dinnertime means better control of morning symptoms. (Take twice-a-day antihistamines in the morning and evening.)
drug;where is tetracycline metabolized?;The majority of first-generation tetracyclines are not metabolized (though 5 % of tetracycline is metabolized to a less active metabolite). Instead, they are most often eliminated by renal excretion. Second-generation tetracyclines are 3 to 5 times more lipophilic, which enhances their tissue penetration. Doxycycline, the most common member of this group, features more than 80 % bioavailability. Bile concentration of doxycycline is 10 to 25 times higher as compared with its serum concentration. High concentrations of doxycycline are found also in kidneys, liver and bowel. Primarily, doxycycline is excreted in bile to feces. Part of doxycycline is inactivated in the liver and 40 % of it is excreted by kidneys in urine.
drug;how to stop taking atorvastatin;"You may think that once your cholesterol goes down, you can stop taking statin medication. But if the drug helped lower your cholesterol, you'll likely need to stay on it for the long term. If you stop taking it, your cholesterol levels will probably go back up.

There is one exception: If you make significant changes to your diet or lose a lot of weight, you may be able to lower and control your cholesterol without medication. However, don't make any changes to your medications without talking to your doctor first."
drug;can you take ultram with ibuprofen?;The maximum recommended dose is 400 mg per day, so if using it alone does not provide adequate relief, other medications can be used with Ultram (tramadol) to help manage the pain. For instance, if there is throbbing pain from tight muscles, a muscle relaxant, such as Flexeril (cyclobenzaprine) or Zanaflex (tizanidine) may be beneficial. NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), such as Aleve (naproxen) or Motrin/Advil (ibuprofen) can be added to help reduce pain caused from swelling.

drug;what size syringe to use for testosterone inject;"The suggested dosage for testosterone cypionate injection varies depending on the age, sex, and diagnosis of the individual patient. Dosage is adjusted according to the patient’s response and the appearance of adverse reactions.

Various dosage regimens have been used to induce pubertal changes in hypogonadal males; some experts have advocated lower dosages initially, gradually increasing the dose as puberty progresses, with or without a decrease to maintenance levels. Other experts emphasize that higher dosages are needed to induce pubertal changes and lower dosages can be used for maintenance after puberty. The chronological and skeletal ages must be taken into consideration, both in determining the initial dose and in adjusting the dose.

For replacement in the hypogonadal male, 50 to 400 mg should be administered every two to four weeks."

drug;how should i dilute ceftriaxone injection?;"Ceftriaxone has been shown to be compatible with Flagyl®*IV (metronidazole hydrochloride). The concentration should not exceed 5 to 7.5 mg/mL metronidazole hydrochloride with ceftriaxone 10 mg/mL as an admixture. The admixture is stable for 24 hours at room temperature only in 0.9% sodium chloride injection or 5% dextrose in water (D5W). No compatibility studies have been conducted with the Flagyl®*IV RTU® or using other diluents. Metronidazole at concentrations greater than 8 mg/mL will precipitate. Do not refrigerate the admixture as precipitation will occur.

Vancomycin and fluconazole are physically incompatible with ceftriaxone in admixtures. When either of these drugs is to be administered concomitantly with ceftriaxone by intermittent intravenous infusion, it is recommended that they be given sequentially, with thorough flushing of the intravenous lines (with one of the compatible fluids) between the administrations.

Do not use diluents containing calcium, such as Ringer’s solution or Hartmann’s solution, to reconstitute ceftriaxone for injection. Particulate formation can result.

Ceftriaxone solutions should not be physically mixed with or piggybacked into solutions containing other antimicrobial drugs or into diluent solutions other than those listed above, due to possible incompatibility (see WARNINGS)."

drug;chlorpheniramine how long in system;Chlorpheniramine has a serum half-life of approximately 20 hours in adults, and elimination from the body is primarily by metabolism to monodesmethyl and didesmethyl compounds. The half-life is increased in the presence of renal dysfunction and decreased in children. The exact mechanism of the presystemic first-pass elimination and the effects of dose levels on the process presently are unclear. Biopharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic studies after single or multiple doses in humans reveal wide interindividual variations in pharmacokinetics. Age, dialysis, urinary pH and flow influence the elimination kinetics of chlorpheniramine.
drug;how long will 6 mgs of suboxone block opiates;"Comparisons of buprenorphine with full agonists such as methadone and hydromorphone suggest that sublingual buprenorphine produces typical opioid agonist effects which are limited by a ceiling effect.

In non-dependent subjects, acute sublingual doses of SUBOXONE tablets produced opioid agonist effects, which reached a maximum between doses of 8 mg and 16mg of SUBUTEX. The effects of 16mg SUBOXONE were similar to those produced by 16mg SUBUTEX (buprenorphine alone).

Opioid agonist ceiling effects were also observed in a double-blind, parallel group, dose ranging comparison of single doses of buprenorphine sublingual solution (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 mg), placebo, and a full agonist control at various doses. The treatments were given in ascending dose order at intervals of at least one week to 16 opioid-experienced, non-dependent subjects. Both drugs produced typical opioid agonist effects. For all the measures for which the drugs produced an effect, buprenorphine produced a dose-related response but, in each case, there was a dose that produced no further effect. In contrast, the highest dose of the full agonist control always produced the greatest effects. Agonist objective rating scores remained elevated for the higher doses of buprenorphine (8-32 mg) longer than for the lower doses and did not return to baseline until 48 hours after drug administrations. The onset of effects appeared more rapidly with buprenorphine than with the full agonist control, with most doses nearing peak effect after 100 minutes for buprenorphine compared to 150 minutes for the full agonist control."
drug;what is marijuana?;"Marijuana is a green, brown, or gray mix of dried, crumbled parts from the marijuana plant. It can be rolled up and smoked like a cigarette or cigar or smoked in a pipe. Sometimes people mix it in food or inhale it using a vaporizer.

Marijuana can cause problems with memory, learning, and behavior. Smoking it can cause some of the same coughing and breathing problems as smoking cigarettes. Some people get addicted to marijuana after using it for a while. It is more likely to happen if they use marijuana every day, or started using it when they were teenagers.

Some states have approved ""medical marijuana"" to ease symptoms of various health problems. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the marijuana plant as a medicine. However, there have been scientific studies of cannabinoids, the chemicals in marijuana. This has led to two FDA-approved medicines. They contain THC, the active ingredient in marijuana. They treat nausea caused by chemotherapy and increase appetite in patients who have severe weight loss from HIV/AIDS. Scientists are doing more research with marijuana and its ingredients to treat many diseases and conditions."
drug;how is marijuana used;Marijuana is best known as a drug that people smoke or eat to get high. It is derived from the plant Cannabis sativa. Possession of marijuana is illegal under federal law.

drug;how is tocilizumab administered;"Tocilizumab injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected intravenously (into a vein) in your arm by a doctor or nurse in a medical office or hospital outpatient clinic or as a prefilled syringe to inject subcutaneously (under the skin) by yourself at home. When tocilizumab is given intravenously to treat rheumatoid arthritis or polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, it is usually given once every 4 weeks. When tocilizumab is given intravenously to treat systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, it is usually given once every 2 weeks. When tocilizumab is given intravenously to treat cytokine release syndrome, it is usually given once, but up to 3 additional doses may be given at least 8 hours apart. It will take about 1 hour for you to receive your dose of tocilizumab injection intravenously. When tocilizumab is given subcutaneously to treat rheumatoid arthritis or giant cell arteritis, it is usually given once weekly or once every other week.

You will receive your first subcutaneous dose of tocilizumab injection in your doctor's office. If you will be injecting tocilizumab injection subcutaneously by yourself at home or having a friend or relative inject the medication for you, your doctor will show you or the person who will be injecting the medication how to inject it. You and the person who will be injecting the medication should also read the written instructions for use that come with the medication.

Thirty minutes before you are ready to inject tocilizumab injection, you will need to remove the medication from the refrigerator, take it out of its carton, and allow it to reach room temperature. When removing a prefilled syringe from the box, be careful not to touch the trigger fingers on the syringe.

drug;what are the side effects of taking the two medication amlodipine metoprolol together;There were six AEs reported in five patients. Peripheral edema 2.97% (3/101) was the most common AE, which was reported in three patients and was related to the study medication, probably to the amlodipine component. All these patients had hemoglobin (Hb) less than 12 g/dL at baseline (one patient had Hb of 11.6 g/dL at baseline, which was 12.1 at end of study and two had 11.7 g/dL which was 11.3 and 12.9 respectively at the end of study). Of these three, one patient had severe peripheral edema and was withdrawn from the study. The patient was followed-up and after a week time peripheral edema was resolved. Peripheral edema of mild and moderate degree was seen in one patient each. In these two patients, edema was resolved and improved respectively. Vertigo, lumbar spondylosis and eosinophilia (considered unlikely due to the study drug), were seen in one patient each and were mild in intensity. Though there were statistically significant changes in sodium, chloride, which showed decrease and blood urea, fasting blood sugar, which were increased, but these were clinically insignificant. Details of laboratory tests are shown in Table 6. The other AEs were of mild severity and not related to the study medication. Table 7 summarizes the AEs.

drug;how do steroids effect the respiratory system;Several efforts have been made to show the beneficial effects of anabolic agents in humans. In malnourished patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) nandrolone decanoate was beneficial in regaining respiratory muscle strength.74Recent data showed an improvement in expiratory and inspiratory muscle strength following treatment with oxandrolone in patients with tetraplegia.75 This increase in muscle strength was attributed to the observed increase in diaphragm muscle mass and resulted in an increased vital capacity. Basin and co-workers showed a beneficial effect of a high dose of testosterone on fat free body mass, muscle size, and peripheral muscle strength in normal men.76 During the 1970s and 1980s several studies were performed to investigate the additional effects of anabolic steroids on a training programme in healthy athletes. The results of these studies varied from no additional effect on muscle force production and no improvement in aerobic capacity77 78 to a small but significant increase in muscle force.

drug;pneumococcal vaccine how often;"CDC recommends routine administration of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13 or Prevnar13®) for all children younger than 2 years of age:

Give PCV13 to infants as a series of 4 doses, one dose at each of these ages: 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and 12 through 15 months.
Children who miss their shots or start the series later should still get the vaccine. The number of doses recommended and the intervals between doses will depend on the child’s age when vaccination begins.

CDC recommends pneumococcal vaccination (PCV13 or Prevnar13®, and PPSV23 or Pneumovax23®) for all adults 65 years or older:

Give a dose of PCV13 to adults 65 years or older who have not previously received a dose. Then administer a dose of PPSV23 at least 1 year later.
If the patient already received one or more doses of PPSV23, give the dose of PCV13 at least 1 year after they received the most recent dose of PPSV23."
drug;is it alright to use fluticasone when using oxygen;Pharmacological therapy can influence morbidity and mortality in severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Long-term domiciliary oxygen therapy (LTOT) improves survival in COPD with chronic hypoxaemia. Oral steroid medication has been associated with improved survival in men and increased mortality in women, while inhaled steroid medication has been associated with a reduction in the exacerbation rate. We have analysed the relationships between pharmacological therapy including oxygen therapy, sex, performance status and need for hospitalization and mortality in 403 patients with COPD (201 men) after their registration in a national oxygen register for LTOT. The mean value of days spent in hospital per year was 44. An increased need of hospital care was independently predicted by a poor performance status, high age and, in women, orally administered steroid medication. Hospital admissions were significantly longer in the terminal stage of COPD among women receiving oral steroid medication. Increased mortality was predicted by a poor performance status and, in women, oral steroid treatment. Predictors of morbidity and mortality during LTOT were found to coincide. The increased mortality in women receiving oral steroid medication was found to be associated with an increased need of hospital care due to longer hospital stays during the terminal stage of the disease. When analysing effects and side-effects of steroid medication in COPD, the possibility of sex-related differences should be considered.

psy;What are the differences between psycho-social and sociology?;While social psychology studies the individual as an actor, the subject of action, sociology focuses more on the structure and functioning of large groups or institutions.
psy;What are the differences between social psychology and general psychology?;General psychology and social psychology are both interested in the individual. However, the former has a more individual approach and the latter a more social one. General psychology pays specific attention to the internal functioning of the individual, while social psychology focuses more on how people influence and perceive themselves and their actions in relation to the social environment.
psy;What are the differences between LOC and causal attribution?;"First of all the LOC (Locus of Control) corresponds to a general anticipation, an a priori expectation. While an Attribution is an explanation, a judgment made a posteriori on a very specific event. Moreover, the concept of LOC concerns reinforcements (""the law of effect"": reproduction of behaviour if positive reinforcements) whereas the concept of attribution refers more to people's behaviour or emotional states."
psy;What could I do when my girlfriend left me after 10 years of living together?;Ten years of living together can only make a difference, regardless of your age. But in a couple, each one evolves, sometimes together and sometimes the opposite. Your friend seems to have taken a direction of freedom. Time will be your ally if she has to come back and wishes to relive a story with you. But maybe not. So try to open yourself up to something else (different activities) and to other people. And you will see things differently. Sincerely.
psy;What could I do when my girlfriend left me after 10 years of living together?;your wife has made it clear from what you say she no longer loves you there is nothing left for you to do but to accept and grieve and leave her without living outside of you without trying to continue to maintain a morbid link.
psy;How to regain an interest in life?;Don't be left alone to mope. As you have been advised, talk about your difficulties and sufferings to your parents, and to your main teacher, if possible before the end of the week to have, before the vacations, an idea of a search for a solution. What would you like to do later? Do you have an idea for a job or studies that attracts you? Is the scientific orientation right for you? Would help during the vacations be able to put you back on your feet and re-motivate you?
psy;How to regain an interest in life?;Find a sport activity for example that suits you. Discover artistic activities and/or go to the cinema, the theater, shows, conferences. It will also allow you to make new friends who will not depend on your school environment. Take care of yourself, be attentive to your lifestyle, your diet, this is essential to cope with life's difficulties and stressful situations. With my encouragement.
psy;My dream is premonitory?;Your dream speaks of your desire. Now that it is clear to you, either you make it happen in reality ... or you continue to dream. Predicting the future is not the job of a psychologist.
psy;Is my dream premonitory?;Nothing can be premonitory, the dream is a safety valve for our body.
psy;Why can't I forget my perverted narcissistic ex-boyfriend?;To begin with, I think that a statement in the gendarmerie should be made for assault and battery in order to protect you but also to protect others. Secondly, I think that this relationship must have provoked a certain amount of physical and psychological fear. In my case, I strongly advise you to consult a psychologist who will tell you how to manage your fears and the fears that are ingrained in you. You can also do hypnosis sessions to let go of all this but before doing so, you should think about consulting a psychologist in order to manage all this.
psy;Why can't I forget my perverted narcissistic ex-boyfriend?;In a relationship between two people and when there is a pervert it is always very important to find out why your relationship is in balance. Indeed as of the first unacceptable behaviors for you, you should have left and you remained to support even more, thus that has a direction for you even if you feel victim, even if you are in a form of masochism, this man came to bring you something in the relation. it is by understanding that that you will be able to leave it and not reproduce again elsewhere.
psy;Why can't I forget my perverted narcissistic ex-boyfriend?;It's quite normal that you don't forget as quickly as that a relationship that must have been traumatic. It seduces you, gets you a job, and then puts you through extreme violence. I hope you have thought about reporting it on the dating site, so that it doesn't continue to be abusive. You now have to rebuild yourself, you have a lot of psychic work to do. You were certainly very afraid when he mistreated you, afraid of dying perhaps when he blocked your breathing! I strongly encourage you to contact either a victim support service at a court or a psychotherapist to get out of the nightmare he made you live with your passive complicity. Do not remain alone with these memories!
psy;How can I restore my man's confidence?;Narcissistic perverts are manipulative, so they know how to seduce you and turn the relationship into something addictive. This may be why you find it hard to forget and have nightmares. I don't know if it's him or you who broke up, but it's a good thing. Be proud of yourself. There's only one thing to do with narcissistic perverts: run away. He may try to come back, and at that point it will be important for you to be strong so you can ignore or push him away. If you feel guilty, know that under no circumstances are you guilty about what happened. 
psy;How can I restore my man's confidence?;Restoring trust to a person means first and foremost trusting him, loving him, adoring him, empowering him, knowing how to forgive, discussing, finding solutions. Act in his interests and your own.
psy;How can I restore my man's confidence?;You seem to be so much in love that you lose your autonomy. And moreover, the first love is not insignificant. Also, you are afraid of losing it. It is important that you find other interests in order to regain your autonomy and your personality (i.e. to live with him but not for him), and to detach yourself from your fear of losing him. If you have been together for 9 years, it means that there is love and that your relationship is serious. But by dint of fear, your behavior, against your conscious will, will eventually drive him away. Go out with friends, enjoy yourself (shopping, fitness, sports, going out...) and if he wants to see his family, do you have to go with him? Make yourself desired to be happy to find yourself afterwards. He needs to see other people and try to understand him on this point. You are young, there are many things to do and you have your life ahead of you. Don't be in too much of a hurry and don't be too impatient. Take your time. To help you let go and feel better about yourself, try meditation, sophrology, yoga... you may find a method that works for you. And if, despite your efforts, this relationship ends, tell yourself that it's not over. There is always something positive in what life gives us, only we don't always see it right away. Have confidence in yourself and in life.
psy;How to react to a person who has paranoid delusions?;If the situation with your friend is bothering you, you need to distance yourself for now. Is this the first time this has happened to her? In any case, if she is in a delirium of persecution or paranoia, do not attack her. You can also talk about it with family and friends to find out if they have been through the same situation before? In any case, don't play into her hands: don't attack her and don't make her feel guilty. If she starts to physically assault you again, call the fire department, they will be able to accompany her to the emergency services nearest her home. Keep me informed.
psy;How to react to a person who has paranoid delusions?;Do you live in or near a major city? If so, and your friend refuses to see a psychiatrist, I recommend that you look up the phone number of SOS Psychiatry, keep it with you and call as soon as a crisis arises. You will then benefit from a home visit, be less exposed, and contact will finally be established.
psy;What are the associations that help paranoid families?;I don't know of any association that deals specifically with paranoid patients or their spouses, and is it prudent or appropriate to advertise (or advertise) under such a name knowing the potential of some of these patients? You can find within associations helping patients and their families in your region (in France?) or on the net you can find interesting sites mostly Canadian dealing with problems of the couple and others for the children of subjects suffering from these disorders you can for example consult the Quebec site.
psy;What are the associations that help paranoid families?;Some choices in life are very difficult and painful. You are in that situation today. Your husband has been under the care of a psychiatrist for many years but he only takes his medication when he feels like it. This shows that your husband has no awareness of his illness: he doesn't realize the seriousness of his paranoia. You are torn between your love for him and the care you can still provide him. This is really admirable on your part, but I think you should listen to the psychiatrist's advice when he tells you to distance yourself. Protect yourself and your children. At the same time, find a professional to support you psychologically because you are going through a difficult time. Also get closer to. Close bones. Speaking of associations, get closer to associations of people with a loved one who has a mental illness. They will be able to provide you with support.
psy;What are the associations that help paranoid families?;Do you know Unafam? Unafam is an association recognized as being of public utility, which welcomes, listens, supports, trains, informs and accompanies the families and the entourage of people living with psychic disorders. You will certainly be able to find on the internet the address closest to your home. Furthermore, I encourage you to look for psychotherapeutic support for yourself in order to help you face a situation that is objectively difficult.
psy;What should I do if I am anxious by nature?;Anxiety if it becomes chronic can be a real torture in everyday life. To relax, you can try relaxation (breathing, massage, meditation), listen to music, practice a sport activity, go for a walk in nature, change the decor of your home. You can also do psychotherapy sessions that will allow you to understand the origin of your anxieties, how to make your emotions flow and find solutions to find a better well-being, that is to say to find a taste for life, the pleasure of doing activities, to take time for yourself.
psy;How can I have a strong character like my friends?;"You ask the question of ""strength of character"" in the sense of the ability to assert oneself, to affirm one's character, to have ""the strength to defend one's opinion, one's choice. Your options"" even if it means making them accepted, if not imposed on the group, or at least sticking to your personal options without feeling ""obliged"" to follow the options of others or to erase yourself in front of them. This requires the ""audacity"" to express yourself without fearing in advance the perhaps critical opinion of others. Also the courage and audacity to believe in the validity of your opinions and your choices without holding them in advance as inferior to those of others: this requires confidence in oneself, in its intrinsic value, the strength of audacity to express one's opinion without retreating before the POSSIBLE existence of one or more different opinions, the audacity of the strength to argue and try to convince without weakening. These traits of ""assertiveness"" are grouped together under the term ""assertiveness"" and you are among those who have a problem at this level. Unfortunately, you do not indicate anything about your age, your activity or your life context. In principle, with the help of a shrink, who is willingly a hypnotherapist, you could correct your difficulties, which can be assimilated to a handicap in relational and social life: this can be corrected by making an effort on yourself, guided by the therapist, at least if you are willing to make this effort. I can't tell you more because I don't have enough data."
psy;How can I have a strong character like my friends?;Are you a teenager? Sometimes it's difficult to impose yourself. But I think, above all, that their character is too strong compared to you, that you feel inferior to them. It would be better to have other friends who are more like you, and with whom you can talk about anything without fear of their reactions. By staying with them, you will continue to suffer, and to be a person that you are not... It's a shame, frankly.
psy;Why don't I have any memories of my childhood?;it can happen that one has the impression to have forgotten everything of the period of childhood - it is due to several factors especially of the emotional series - but it is difficult to answer you by not knowing anything about you apart from your age, background, profession, family situation and life of possible couple.
psy;Why don't I have any memories of my childhood?;So far, I've been able to meet people who had different types of memories, concept-related memories (without being able to associate a date to them), emotional memories (who remember what they felt but didn't necessarily see or hear), visual memories, auditory memories? What type of memory do you have and has it happened recently that you find it difficult to remember a person without some other type of clue? A person can also forget everything after a trauma. Perhaps there are still other clues...
psy;Why don't I have any memories of my childhood?;No memories? Or no visual memories? Sometimes it's easier to find sensations, smells, touches, than to see scenes again. Especially when you feel worried, as you do. If necessary, consult a hypnotherapist in order to intensify the tenuous threads that connect you to your childhood. The unconscious never forgets anything...
psy;Why don't I have any memories of my childhood?;Many people have what are called defensive mechanisms that prevent them from recovering their memories, which does not allow them to access their traumas that lead to various problems in their lives. In therapy, the use of hypnosis often helps to reduce resistance and thus to bring back memories.
psy;Why don't I have any memories of my childhood?;Forgetfulness is an ability of our brain. Sometimes we forget where we put our keys when we hold them in our hands. The brain plays tricks on us! I say capacity because it allows us to free the system (the hard disk) to store other important information. Of course, some may not be immediately accessible or not at all. This is often characterized by the way and intensity in which we experienced the situation. I'm sure you remember your last burst of laughter, don't you? So to conclude, it's a matter of identifying the most beautiful memories you've experienced lately, and others again, just to see that everything is going well and that your emotions bring you back unconditionally to your most ingrained memories!
psy;I would like to know a precise definition of cognitive disorders.;Cognitive disorders are simply disorders of cognition, i.e. knowledge or information that affects the memory, but not only. 
psy;How to become mature at 16?;Each person is unique. You're wondering how to become more mature at 16. How old is your boyfriend? What are the elements or facts that make him think you are immature? Is it in the way you talk, dress and behave with others? Is it the way you make decisions, do things, laugh? Is it in the way you love him? At 16 years old, a certain immaturity is not extraordinary because you are still in your teens while you are moving towards adulthood. In a couple, everyone evolves differently but too much difference can destroy the couple. In your situation, your boyfriend seems much more mature than you, so he has different expectations of you, he expects you to behave like an adult. Your immaturity must create discomfort for him towards others and perhaps shame. So try to change your behavior: be more of an adult than a child. This will avoid distension within your couple.
psy;How can I make my husband understand that he has a psychological problem?;I advise you to first take your husband for a consultation with a psychologist or psychotherapist, who will be able to guide you.
psy;How can I help my mother get out of her depression?;If your mother starts to feel depressed, she can go to a medical center to see a shrink. It's free and it can help her. Congratulations on your maturity.
psy;How do I stop drinking?;To stop drinking, you must first of all want to. Then, depending on your state of addiction, it is important to take stock of your situation with a doctor who will prescribe a check-up and, if necessary, medication to help you, especially if you show signs of withdrawal. Finally, to reconstruct your behavioral pattern and respond differently to what pushes you towards alcohol, complementary therapy is very important. Hypnosis, EFT, or other. Finally, moving physically indicates to your unconscious mind that you want to move. Establish new habits. A.A. is people who will understand you if you accept their help. There is no magic bullet: decide and do what works for you.
psy;How can I stop drinking?;Stopping drinking, so possibly if you decide to do so, short-term therapy can help. Therapy and hypnosis do not help you to make the decision but more importantly to validate the decision and to understand and help.
psy;Existential death anxiety, how to get rid of it?;Anxiety is often linked to the fact that it is difficult to live in the present. Anticipation, which is a normal activity of the brain, with another part looking for solutions to a whole series of hypothetical hypotheses, can become pervasive and harmful. It doesn't matter what logical reasons and explanations you can come up with. Hypnosis, which addresses the unconscious mind, is perfectly suited to solving this type of difficulty.
psy;Existential death anxiety, how to get rid of it?;I invite you to consult a psychologist-psychotherapist to talk about your death anxieties and understand where they come from in order to calm them. Talking about them in therapy will allow you to work on them, to express your emotions and related elements of your story in order to relieve you of finding yourself in a dynamic life.
psy;How can I calm my anxiety when I'm alone?;"So this is the technique I have been using for the last 50 years. It's all based on breathing. 1- Slow and deep abdominal breathing throughout the exercise. 2- You try to mentally project on your forehead a view that reminds you of a happy time in your life, the goal is to mobilize your mind and ""keep it from wandering"". 3- You start from the tip of your feet and work your way up to your ears by contracting and relaxing every muscle you find. There you are relaxed and remain in slow breathing for two or three minutes. If you are lying down, you will sleep fast. This exercise is very simple, after a few days it will become reflex and well coordinated. Normally you regain control of your body and your life. Try on the Internet there are lots of relaxation exercises, this one is the simplest and I assure you that it works. I hope I have contributed to a little more control of yourself in a calm and gentle way."
psy;How can I calm my anxiety when I'm alone?;Your resistance to stress, which has an important biological support, also requires a healthy lifestyle: a healthy and balanced diet, the practice of sports and a good sleep. A good relational network and a good work/leisure balance will also be very useful to you. I also invite you to reconsider the decisions to be taken, one after the other, use writing for this, a notebook for example, which will give trace to your reflection. You will be able to build up your reflection in this way and thus establish the best action plans. This will calm you down and you will regain control of your life. Become more confident in a life that is generous, this mental attitude will open up more favorable and fulfilling possibilities for you. It will also generate greater mental and physical energy. New opportunities are opening up for you, rejoice!
psy;How do you help someone with agoraphobia?;First of all, make sure it is agoraphobia. The diagnosis is a matter for a specialist and not a rough search on the Internet or in a medical book. Similarly, the management will be done with a shrink. This is the first step in alleviating the girl's suffering and that of your friend.
psy;How do you help someone with agoraphobia?;"Agoraphobia is very disabling because it often locks people in their homes and creates a real withdrawal. The first step to get out of any type of phobia is the will to... The results will only be positive if your friend's daughter sincerely wishes to get out of this ""hell"". This agoraphobia can also be the consequence of a deeper evil often creating a significant self-confidence problem. A therapist can accompany your friend's daughter on the road to rebirth. Talk to her about it and see if she is open to consulting a professional. It's a great way to continue on your life's path."
psy;How to get rid of bad thoughts?;"What you are describing manifests an old and familiar suffering which escapes you, which hides, but which acts in the shadows, through these ""bad thoughts"" from which you are suffering. In order for them to leave you, it is necessary to take a therapeutic approach with a professional able to listen to what escapes you, the unconscious, and which is based on what you experienced in early childhood. It will be about talking about your early childhood, what was experienced by your mother during pregnancy, about family history, and about finding out what was difficult and painful when you were very young. You will gradually discover this kind of reflex, unconscious, which locks you up. As you speak and be truly listened to, these ideas will gradually fade away and give way to the recognition of the good things that life gives you to experience."

But his criticisms are always explicit, embellished with disadvantageous comparisons. Not enough to feed self-esteem ... And you should question your attachment style (dependent?). You might want to shed some light on these issues in therapy to improve your image a little.
psy;My friend is sleeping with his 9 year old daughter, is this normal?;"No, it's not good for your companion to sleep with his daughter, it's an incestuous relationship, where everyone finds something that they like, but which is false: his daughter is not his companion. She is not in a girl's place, she is in a false place that will prevent her from building a healthy and peaceful relational life, with boys and then with men. You are clairvoyant, you are in a place of humiliation, as if you were a mistress that your companion leaves behind for an incestuous relationship. Your relationship to you 2 also becomes false, as your companion refuses to listen to you.
"
psy;Why can't I figure out what I want.;Doubts, prospects, forgetting who we are and our resources are even more topical questions. Faced with this, a moment to reflect, take stock and listen to yourself and with advice may be necessary. With kindness, empathy and without judgment, I also consult visio (Doctolib): this allows great discretion and confidentiality, without moving and at times when you are available.
psy;I would like help with my emotions;Not being able to cry is not necessarily a sign that you are a monster. You may be cut off from your emotions for one reason or another. Probably for protection. Sometimes some men forbid themselves to cry in order to appear stronger, for example ... Anyway you have established this defense system, perhaps not to suffer, to protect yourself, Crying can be scary but also good. Not being able to cry is painful. And then, sadness can also manifest itself in other ways than crying. Moreover, when faced with death, everyone reacts in a different way. There is not only sadness as an emotion, but also anger, shame, fear, guilt ... which moreover you may experience when you realize that you are unable to cry. There are also other emotions like joy, love, relief.
psy;Misophonia: where can it come from?;"I am inclined to think that you have done some kind of reflex conditioning ""the feelings which have now become automatic when I sit at the table"". Like a kind of learning that sticks to the idea that at the table you feel this, as we have insomniacs who cannot sleep on the sofa or the armchair and no longer in their bed because when they go to their bed they have associated the idea that in bed they cannot sleep, as a kind of reflex. With the help of a professional, in addition to working on the cause of misophonia and what it means to you, you could work on breaking this automatic mechanism."
psy;I have problems with my roommate;Too bad we don't know if you are a boy or a girl as it may matter. Indeed, if you are male, your roommate can project more onto you what bothers her and what she feels for her boyfriend. Indeed, it is easier to be in a bad mood against you than against him! If you are a girl, you are also the one who realizes the situation, who witnesses the repercussion of what you call miseries and you witness their impact. In a way, you represent a bit of her Jiminy Criquet, who shows her what does not work but that she refuses to hear because it is painful and shows that what she is experiencing does not make her blossom.
psy;Am I asexual or do I have a blockage?;Too bad you do not specify your age. If you've never managed to feel sexually fulfilled before, it's time to see a therapist. Penetration is often badly experienced for different reasons, religious, cultural, trauma from the past, etc ... The hypnotherapy that I practice is relevant to go to the source of your blockage. Only verbal therapy will not be of much interest.
psy;Problem with fire;Fire has a fascinating side to the extent that it is an element that lives its life, that it is difficult to control, because from a simple spark it can become devastating. He faces the risk that we think we can manage but which in the end can turn into a nightmare. This is a bit like what happens for someone who plays roulette at the Casino, he knows that he can lose everything, but has such an adrenaline rush when he plays, that it becomes enjoyable. And besides, do we not say “Play with fire”…. to clearly show this part of pleasure and fear which accompanies this fascination. To come back to your son, perhaps there is there this illusion of power, of power, over this element of nature that he would like to control - fire - but at the same time this fear which excites and gives some pleasure. Here is a line of thought to be explored with a professional.
psy;My mom's illness, I feel guilty;You have worn a lot. You have given a lot. Today you are saturated, exhausted. You took on the role of the adult when you were a child. The roles have been reversed and it is time for everyone to take their place. Your mother is an adult. There are bodies to help the sick or disabled. Social worker, doctor, psychiatrist ... I invite you to delegate, that your mother takes care of herself and especially that you take care of yourself! Psychology has done you good so go on with the same person or another. You need support.
psy;How can we help if one of our loved ones is psychologically ill?;Who is this close to you? son, brother? Your intention is laudable but you do not have the power to force him to consult, to be helped, if he does not wish to. On the other hand, you can invite him to do it, perhaps bring him books like that of Lise Bourbeau the 5 injuries that prevent being yourself.
psy;I have a problem with my father;Maybe you should focus on yourself and not on what you cannot control, your inner conflicts are taking over your behavior, I am talking about the problems of your parents who have developed in you a lack of confidence and a need of recognition and certainly a deep malaise.
psy;Hello, what do you think of the adults who were too brooded in childhood;Hello, what do you think of the adults who were too brooded in childhood
psy;My love situation prevents me from moving forward;You need to recreate a space for communication and a strong bond of trust with your partner if you want to continue together.
psy;Adolescence is the important glue for adult life.;It is true that adolescence is a turning point in a person's life. Bodily, hormonal, psychological, social changes… but nothing is definitely over. It is a period of construction with ups and downs. And so we cannot speak in binary terms, that is to say that if it goes well - OR - badly the game will be made for the rest of life. Not only do all the transitions exist but when things get hard at certain times, if you feel that you are losing your footing a little, it is always possible to be accompanied by family, relatives, teachers…. a shrink… .in order to be an actor in one's own story rather than a victim of what one has trouble managing. Certainly, depending on how adolescence is experienced, the personality will be affected. But the environment, the chance of encounters, individual choices, joys, sorrows, all this contributes to the construction of the personality in a flexible and responsible manner.
